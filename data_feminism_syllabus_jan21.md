# **Course Description**

> Data is often perceived as objective and impartial, but the processes
> of data collection, analysis, and visualization are deeply influenced
> by existing power structures. In this course, we will explore the
> intersection of data and these power structures through the lens of
> feminist theory. Examining the intersection of data with gender, race,
> class, and disability, we will question how data can both reinforce
> and challenge systems of oppression. Readings and discussions will
> center on the experiences of the affected communities as we explore
> methods to make data practices more inclusive and equitable. Through
> the combination of readings, class discussions, and hands-on
> activities, students will engage with key concepts in data feminism.
> We will apply these concepts to real-world examples, using Python for
> data analysis. No prior programming experience is required, as the
> course will provide the necessary foundational skills. By the end of
> the course, students will be equipped to critically analyze data
> practices and contribute to more just and ethical data-driven
> decision-making.

# **Key Learning Outcomes**

> ❏ Critically examine how different data practices can either reinforce
> or\
> challenge existing power structures at the intersection of gender,
> race, class,\
> and disability
>
> ❏ Understand the origins and impacts of algorithmic bias and be able
> to\
> critique algorithms from an intersectional feminist perspective
>
> ❏ Critique and design data collection and analysis methods that
> prioritize\
> inclusivity, transparency, and accountability
>
> ❏ Effectively communicate the results of data analyses with an
> emphasis on\
> clarity, accessibility, and impact

# **Required Background and Prerequisite Knowledge**

> No prior coding experience is required! While we will be utilizing
> Python, it will primarily be used for understanding concepts. Python
> assignments will not be graded on ability to code, but on
> understanding of concepts of data analysis, data visualization, and
> algorithmic bias.

**[NOTE:]{.underline}** The above actual dates may be modified due to
the requirements of the class. Also, the indicated dates may be moved
backward or forward depending on class progress. **Exact dates and
instructions will be announced on the course webpage**.

**Access Services**

Bryn Mawr College is committed to providing equal access to students
with a documented disability. Students needing academic accommodation
for a disability must first speak with Access Services. Students can
email <accessservices@brynmawr.edu> to request an appointment to begin
this confidential process. If eligible for accommodation as per Access
Services, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can discuss
and implement proposed accommodations. More information can be obtained
from the Access Services website.
(<http://www.brynmawr.edu/access-services/>)

Any student who has a disability-related need to record this class must
first be found eligible to do so by Access Services and must share this
eligibility with the instructor. Class members need to be aware that
this class may be recorded.

**Academic Integrity**

Each student is expected to follow the Bryn Mawr Honor Code. It is
expected that all submitted work is your own with all sources used cited
in the text or code, including large language models (such as ChatGPT).

I highly encourage students to engage in collaborative learning
throughout the course including the coding assignments. However, direct
copying of another student's code is prohibited. Focus on discussing
concepts and problem-solving approaches with your peers but ensure all
submitted work reflects your own understanding and effort. If you work
with another student on a weekly assignment, please note that at the top
of the assignment.

**AI Policy**

AI programs (e.g., ChatGPT) can be useful to help generate ideas,
brainstorm, and simplify tasks. You should, however, note that the
material generated by these programs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or
otherwise problematic. Please beware that the use of AI may also stifle
your own independent thinking and creativity. You may not submit any
work generated by an AI program as your own.  If you include material
generated by an AI program, it should be cited like any other reference
material (with due consideration for the quality of the reference, which
may be poor).  Any plagiarism or other form of cheating via AI will be
considered a violation of the Bryn Mawr Honor Code.

**Attendance**

Regular attendance is strongly encouraged. In-class activities,
discussions, and peer feedback are crucial components of this course and
significantly enhance the learning experience.

-   **Illness:** If you are unable to attend class due to illness,
    please notify me as soon as possible. I will work with you to
    provide any missed materials or assignments.

-   **Religious Observances:** I respect the importance of religious
    observances. Please inform me in advance if you anticipate missing
    class due to a religious holiday, so we can make appropriate
    arrangements.

**The Writing Center**

Professional writers and scholars routinely seek feedback on their work
from trusted peers. I encourage everyone to schedule conferences at the
Writing Center to discuss, plan, or revise drafts. To schedule an
appointment, go
to <https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/offices-services/writing-center> or
click \"Make a Writing Center Appt\" from the Library and Academic
Support dropdown menu at the top of every Moodle page.
