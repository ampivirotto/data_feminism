    initiative trying to solve? Summarize how the data initiative of
    interest is collecting and using the data. (1 minute)

3.  Introduce one (1) of your comparative initiatives. Discuss one thing
    that fits well within your chosen ethical framework (i.e. something
    you think the initiative is doing well) and an area that could use
    improvement. (2 minutes)

4.  Suggested discussion questions:

    a.  Why did you pick this particular data initiative?

    b.  Where there any ways that your original data initiative did a
        poor job aligning with your chosen ethical framework?

        field?
