Questions:

1.  What would a \'Data Workers\' Union\' look like, and what kinds of
    protections or rights might it advocate for? Consider the different
    types of labor involved in data work -- from gig workers labeling
    datasets to salaried data scientists designing algorithms. What
    challenges might arise in organizing such a union, and how might
    companies respond?

2.  Many tech companies promote values like transparency, collaboration,
    and openness -- yet their labor practices are often contradictory.
    For example, GitHub highlights open-source work supporting making
    certain types of labor visible, yet Chapter 7 highlights how the
    company failed to support women employees. What types of labor does
    GitHub not support in making visible? How do data-driven companies
    use transparency as a branding tool? When does this transparency
    extend to (or exclude) the labor that makes their work possible?

3.  In our current world, algorithms are often used to govern workers'
    schedules, tasks, and productivity with examples including supply
    chain software from the reading and healthcare systems that assign
    productivity scores to each shift. What data is collected in these
    systems? How does the data affect the software? How might workers
    push back against algorithmic control? Are there any situations
    where algorithmic management could benefit workers?

Pick one question from the following list:

1.  Datasets, like a traditional supply chain, can be difficult to
    navigate; despite the efficacy of collaborative platforms like
    GitHub, data can travel through many hands before a data scientist
    begins to work with it, in addition to the undervalued work of data
    entry, screening, etc. often performed by marginalized groups.
    Recalling the idea of \"strangers in the dataset,\" how do you think
    data professionals can make unseen labor visible in practice while
    navigating a murky data supply chain?

2.  In the SAP supply chain management system, tasks are divided among
    specialists, and they can only access the modules relevant to their
    specific job position. Therefore, no one individual sees the full
    view of the supply chain, as they are limited to the scope of their
    work. How might this narrow view affect workers or the quality of
    the production schedule? If specialists were given more context to
    the data they received and collaborated more, would the SAP program
    be better utilized or should more variable be inputted into the
    system instead?

3.  Posner in The Software That Shapes Workers\' Lives highlights how
    poor communication and complexity in global supply chains make it
    hard to see where products come from and the conditions in which
    they are made. How can improving communication and reducing
    information gaps help identify roles in production, and what can
    companies do to ensure transparency from start to finish?

4.  How does refusing data collection, as discussed in Data Feminism
    Chapter 7 , challenge the common belief that more data leads to
    better decision-making? In what ways can refusal serve as a form of
    resistance, and how can it be used strategically to challenge power
    imbalances in data systems?

5.  Miriam Posner's New Yorker piece talks about how many of us are able
    to live in a "fantasy of friction-free procurement" because we can't
    see the labor and suffering that goes into bringing us the products
    we want. The Data Feminism chapter talks about how much of the labor
    that goes into creating data, code, and technology is purposely
    unshown and unseen because the people doing that work are
    marginalized and mistreated. How can we make people in the
    privileged groups want to learn about the invisible labor that is
    much of data and supply chain work? If that's not super possible, is
    it important to teach them anyway? Why or why not and how?

6.  Chapter 7 discusses Principle 7 of Data Feminism, which aims to make
    labor visible. What are some ways labor has been hidden? what has
    already been done to tackle this problem and what further changes
    can help recognize hidden labor more, as well as address potential
    biases?

7.  Ch 7 of Data Feminism discusses how many contributions are
    overlooked, especially those from marginalized groups. What are some
    ways that organizations or teams can make labor more visible in
    data-driven projects? How could this improve accountability and
    fairness in the field? Have you ever done work that was undervalued
    in a group project/workplace? Did that affect your motivation to
    contribute?

8.  The Software That Shapes Worker's Lives highlights how software
    systems shape and often constrain workers\' autonomy, making aspects
    of their labor invisible. And, Data Feminism's chapter 7 talks about
    recognizing and valuing hidden labor in technology. How do the
    systems in the reading doubt workers' contributions, and how might
    transparency (open-source tools like GitHub) help challenge these
    inequalities? Are there systemic barriers that these technologies
    alone cannot overcome?

9.  Posner mentions that worker welfare directly opposes the efficiency
    of using supply chain management systems, like a PP/DS. Do you think
    that technology can ethically be used to increase efficiency, and if
    so, what safeguards have to be in place for workers? In a system
    intentionally designed to avoid individual responsibility, how can
    those at each step of the chain (consumer, store owner,
    manufacturer, ...) ensure the safety and ethicality of the system?

10. In the Data Feminism chapter, many of the data visualizations for
    unsung data used more creative and unique methods, like the chart of
    hospitalizations being shown in the shape of a body, or the 'crip
    time' as petals. What is a possible reason for the overlap between
    marginalized data and the more artistic visualizations? Are they
    better at getting the point across?
