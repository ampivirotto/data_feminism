**Matrix of Domination Data Power Analysis**

This process will be very similar to the rubric for your final project
proposal where you identify a data initiative of interest and analyze
the ways in which it might amplify or address specific power structures.

1.  Choose a dataset or data collection initiative of your choice to
    analyze. Several options are suggested below, but feel free to
    choose another option as well.

2.  Explore the data provided (this could be an actual table or just a
    series of drop downs to explore the dataset). Write a short summary
    of what data is collected and how they did the collection (if
    possible).

3.  Answer the following questions, thinking about the matrix of
    domination domains of power:

    a.  Structural Power

        i.  Who created this dataset?

        ii. What institutions or people are responsible for managing
            this dataset?

        iii. Who is represented (and who is missing) from the data
             collected?

    b.  Disciplinary Power

        i.  How might data collection methods (e.g., surveys,
            algorithms, official records) reinforce or obscure
            inequalities?

        ii. How is the data used? Could this be used in AI systems?

    c.  Hegemonic Power

        i.  What assumptions about any marginalized identity are
            embedded in this dataset?

        ii. Does this data influence public perception?

        iii. Can this data be used in any way to support a specific
             discriminatory narrative?

    d.  Interpersonal Power:

        i.  Who benefits from the collection and usage of the data?

        ii. Are the voices of those affected by this data included in
            the decision-marking about the methodology and usage?

4.  Be ready to share your dataset along with about 2 minutes of
    analysis of what your group has identified.

Dataset Suggestions:

-   World Bank Open Data (<https://data.worldbank.org/indicator>) -- A
    great resource for exploring a variety of socioeconomic, climate,
    health, and education indicators across many different countries.
    Please feel free to pick any indicator that interests you -- even if
    there's not data for all countries or years, you can discuss what's
    missing and why that might be.

-   FBI Crime Data Explorer
    (<https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home>) -- There are
    tabs to look at crime and hate crime data by state and by crime.
    There's also the ability to download some of the data -- a question
    to ask yourselves if you choose this dataset, is what data is
    available to me? Why is this data presented in this way?

-   Mapping Police Violence (<https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/>) -- A
    collection of mostly public data about police violence in
    communities. If you choose this dataset, in addition to the
    graphics, check out their helpful 'View the data' section along with
    the section on their very thorough methodology
    (<https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/methodology>).

-   CDC National Center for Health Statistics
    (<https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/>) -- Two interfaces to this data
    collection include the Query Tool which allows for picking specific
    groups and visit types
    (<https://nchsdata.cdc.gov/DQS/#nchs-home_arthritis-diagnosis/-/total/all-time-periods/1>)
    and the dataset in the form of a table
    (<https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/DQS-NHIS-Adult-Summary-Health-Statistics/pg2r-sfcx/about_data>)

-   Eviction Lab (<https://evictionlab.org/>) -- Based out of Princeton
    University they collect data from across the country about eviction
    rates. Things to note for this data collection, (1) they have a
    easy-to-find section on their methods
    (<https://evictionlab.org/methods/>) and (2) you can request the
    dataset itself at this link
    (<https://evictionlab.org/get-the-data/>)

-   US DOE Office for Civil Rights Data on Equal Access to Education
    (<https://ocrdata.ed.gov/>) -- This explores data about school
    statistics along with information about opportunity and discipline
    within the schools. For this dataset, you can explore the data in
    browser by state, but there are also links to download the pieces of
    the dataset as well.

-   AI Incident Database (<https://incidentdatabase.ai/>) -- This
    database collects instances where the usage of AI has created harm
    in the world through collective submission mechanisms. Note that
    they have several different viewing types (Table, List, Spatial).
