**Scenario: Developing a Health Monitoring App.**

You are part of a team developing a health monitoring app to help users
track their heart health. The app collects data such as heart rate,
activity levels, sleep patterns, and user-reported stress levels. The
data will be analyzed to provide personalized health recommendations and
risk alerts for conditions like heart disease.

**Key Considerations:**

-   The app will primarily use wearable fitness tracker data but will
    also ask users to self-report certain behaviors and symptoms.

-   The app is funded by a healthcare company that wants to use
    aggregated data to inform new product development.

-   It will be marketed to a general audience (as defined by the
    healthcare company), but the initial dataset comes from a clinical
    trial with participants who are mostly middle-aged men.

Data Process:

1.  Defining the Problem

2.  Data Collection

3.  Data Cleaning

4.  Data Analysis

5.  Interpretation

6.  Visualization/Communication

7.  Action
