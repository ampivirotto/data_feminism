Questions:

1.  Imagine you are responsible for creating national guidelines for
    data collection. Do you think such guidelines are feasible? Why or
    why not? If you believe they are possible, how would you approach
    their development, and what key elements should they include? If you
    think they are not, discuss the challenges or reasons such
    guidelines may not be practical or advisable.

2.  Recently, a significant amount of publicly available government data
    has been removed from websites
    (<https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html>).
    Explore the types of data being removed and the communities or
    groups most affected by these decisions. Who benefits from the
    removal of this data, and who is harmed? What, if anything, can be
    done to support those affected by this loss of access?

3.  Mimi Ọnụọha's *Library of Missing Datasets*
    (<https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets-v3>) is a
    collection of projects highlighting datasets that are
    absent---either because they were never collected or because they
    remain private. The most recent addition features a file cabinet
    representing datasets that benefit communities by remaining
    uncollected. In the project\'s GitHub repository
    (<https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets>), Ọnụọha outlines
    four key reasons why data may be missing, along with a list of
    missing datasets. Choose several datasets from the list and discuss
    why they are missing, making connections to the four proposed
    reasons.

Pick two of the following discussion questions:

1.  Are the community based "data for co-liberation" projects such as
    the Groundwork Somerville mural more or less effective in reaching
    their target audiences than bigger, internet driven projects like
    the mapping projects that we see in Chapter 5 of Data Feminism? Is
    direct participation by the public the best way to inform them? Is
    there a way to give these projects a bigger scope without losing the
    participatory effect?

2.  In Chapter 5 of Data Feminism, a map of evictions near big tech
    company shuttle spots is displayed. We can clearly see that these
    companies are, whether purposeful or not, pushing out previous
    tenants by driving up rent prices. Using the data presented by this
    map, what would you suggest needs to happen in order to change these
    rising prices? How would you spread the word to others, and convince
    those in power that this issue must be addressed?

3.  A common argument against programs to benefit those in lower income
    brackets is that people will \"game the system.\" Yet, in chapter 5
    of Data Feminism, the authors discuss a situation in which Google
    used public city bus stops, which were before used by lower income
    residents, to transport their employees into Silicon Valley in
    luxury commuter buses. The Missing Data reading discusses the
    importance of certain missing data not falling into the wrong hands,
    specifically those who might use the data to further oppression,
    even though the collection of the missing data is a step towards
    liberation. Who is really \"gaming the system?\" Why are people in
    power so afraid of these initiatives when they simultaneously use
    them to increase their own wealth and power? What are other examples
    of those in power exploiting systems meant to help others?

4.  On page 128 of Data Feminism, the authors discuss how the AEMP map
    counterintuitively uses occlusion to emphasize its message. Is this
    effective? We have discussed in past weeks how to present data in a
    way that "institutions that have vested interest in maintaining the
    status quo" (to cite a question from last week) cannot ignore. The
    AEMP map is almost artistic in its rendering of the data. Could art
    be a medium of communication for data justice?

5.  DATA SETS vs DATA SETTINGS (page 132): At what point does cleaning
    data sets erase vital information? How can we clean our data in a
    way that makes it usable but holds onto the context in which it was
    collected?

6.  The Missing Data reading talks about the paradox of exposure: how
    some communities want to be counted for rights and recognition, but
    also fear surveillance and harm. Data Feminism warns against data
    collection practices that prioritize control over care. I'm curious:
    can we think of examples where being counted has helped a community?
    Or where being counted has put people at risk? How should we balance
    the need for representation with the dangers of overexposure? How do
    we decide when collecting data is empowering vs. when it is
    exploitative? Can you think of a situation where data was collected
    without considering the impact on the people involved?

7.  Where does the need for data cleaning come from? Why is it deemed
    important? Can data cleaning be done in a way that preserves the
    complexity of the collected data, or does one have to be prioritized
    over the other?

8.  Jungs De Almeida, Lauren Klein, and Catherine D'Ignazio state that
    "missing data is a relational concept." Keeping this in mind, how
    can data scientists collect data in order to combat missing data
    without over-surveilling the groups which they aim to protect?
    Should this work be done by someone within the group the missing
    data effects, or should it be outsourced to other data scientists?

9.  Using the definition of missing data as defined by the MIT article,
    come up with an example of how missing data could lead to
    misrepresentation of certain groups. Detail what data is missing,
    what group(s) is being excluded, the impact this may have, and what
    you would do to solve the issue.

10. Both of this week\'s readings draw on the theme of accountability;
    the Data Feminism reading discusses the importance of transparency
    in methodology and potential biases of data collection, and the
    Missing Data reading explores how initiatives to collect missing
    data hold governments and corporations accountable. How does the
    theme of transparency and accountability contradict the norms of
    today\'s capitalistic society? How are the accountabilities of the
    organizations collecting data and governments intertwined? How can
    we encourage people to become involved in citizen science data
    collection efforts to further our collective good?

11. On page 139, the authors of Data Feminism discuss the importance of
    "creating new knowledge and new designs from the margins." The
    missing data reading talks about the deliberate choice not to
    collect certain data by governing bodies. How can using the strategy
    outlined in Data Feminism be used effectively against this problem?

12. In Data Feminism, the authors emphasize that those closest to a
    problem should lead the solutions, yet many data-driven projects are
    designed by outsiders. Similarly, Missing Data highlights cases
    where governments collect data that serves their own interests
    rather than the needs of the communities they study. Have you ever
    seen a situation where data was used to frame a problem in a way
    that ignored the experiences of the people affected? How can we
    shift decision-making power in data projects to those who are most
    impacted?

13. How is missing data used as an oppressive tool? Detail some current
    events that show this oppression tactic in use. Who is behind these
    actions? What is their goal? What are ways to combat this?

14. Chapter 5 of Data Feminism discusses how negative
    externalities---unintended harms that fall disproportionately on
    marginalized groups---result from data-driven systems that
    prioritize efficiency and profit over equity and care. How do these
    negative externalities connect to the problem of missing data?
