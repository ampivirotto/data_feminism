Counter Data Activity

In this activity, you will critically analyze a series of real-world
scenarios where data and algorithms are used in ways that impact
society. Your task is to think about possible counter examples or
alternative data that could challenge or provide a more comprehensive
view of each situation. Consider how different data perspectives might
reveal hidden biases or highlight inequities and explore how these
counter examples could lead to more inclusive and fairer outcomes.

**Instructions:**

1.  Read your scenario carefully.

2.  For your scenario, think of alternative data sources or counter
    examples that could challenge the claims being made or provide a
    more nuanced understanding of the situation.

3.  Reflect on how the inclusion of these counter data examples could
    change the conclusions or decisions being made in the scenario.

1.  A city uses a predictive policing algorithm that helps law
    enforcement decide where to deploy officers based on crime reports
    and 911 calls. The system relies on historical crime data to
    identify \"high-risk\" neighborhoods and allocate police resources
    accordingly. Officials claim this method is \"data-driven\" and
    improves public safety.

2.  A national census survey asks respondents to select their gender,
    offering only two options: Male or Female. The data is used for
    policymaking, funding allocations, and social research. Government
    officials say the binary categories make the data more \"consistent
    and comparable\" over time.

3.  A government maternal mortality database tracks pregnancy-related
    deaths based on hospital records and official death certificates.
    Reports based on this data claim that maternal health is improving
    nationwide. However, some public health researchers believe the
    numbers don't tell the whole story.

4.  A major social media platform has policies in place to prevent
    misinformation and hate speech. Automated moderation tools remove
    content that violates these rules. Recently, activists and
    journalists have reported that certain posts discussing specific
    political events and views are disappearing or getting flagged as
    violations. The company insists that its content moderation policies
    are fair and neutral.

5.  A national employment survey collects data on jobs, wages, and
    workforce participation. The report is used to shape labor policies
    and economic programs. However, some economists argue that this data
    does not fully capture the experiences of all workers in society.

6.  In a bustling urban hospital, a team of data scientists has
    developed an algorithm designed to predict patient outcomes based on
    a wide range of factors---age, gender, race, and socioeconomic
    status. The hospital has been struggling to manage limited
    resources, and the algorithm was created to help prioritize care for
    those most in need. However, as the team begins to analyze the
    algorithm's predictions, they notice troubling trends: it appears
    that women and people of color are less likely to be recommended for
    certain life-saving treatments, even when their medical conditions
    are like others who receive the care.

7.  At a growing tech company, hiring decisions are increasingly
    influenced by a new software system that analyzes resumes to
    recommend candidates based on a set of predefined criteria. The
    algorithm scans a resume for keywords---prestigious university
    degrees, years of experience in high-profile positions, and even
    salary history---and ranks applicants accordingly. On the surface,
    it seems like a perfectly efficient way to streamline the hiring
    process. But as the hiring manager starts reviewing the results,
    something feels off. The software seems to favor candidates who come
    from affluent backgrounds or who have worked at certain well-known
    companies.
