    "Similar to learning other languages, programming languages also depend on grammatical rules that govern the way the language is utilized. In this workshop, we will begin by learning some of the basic rules of Python. These rules will give you foundational knowledge which can then be leveraged towards completing and solving more complex problems. \n",

    "Programs are made up of expressions, which describe to the computer how to combine pieces of data. For example, a multiplication expression consists of a * symbol between two numerical expressions. Expressions, such as 3 * 4, are evaluated by the computer. The value (the result of evaluation) of the last expression in each cell, 12 in this case, is displayed below the cell.\n",
