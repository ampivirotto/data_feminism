Questions:

1.  Both readings highlight how visualizations don't just present data
    but instead also shape how we interpret the data. Consider a data
    visualization that changed your opinion or reinforced a belief, what
    about the design made it so impactful? Can framing in data
    visualizations be ethically used for advocacy or does it always
    carry the risk of manipulation?

2.  Look at the following two figures. Each have gotten quite a bit of
    discourse about decisions made in the visualization of their data
    (homicides by gun in Florida and deaths during the Iraqi conflict).
    Why do you think these figures are divisive?\

3.  You will be assigned a data story or data visualization from the
    list below. Please take a couple minutes to understand at least one
    of the visualizations on the page. Based on the readings and the
    lecture on Monday, (1) identify one thing that the visualization
    does well, (2) identify one thing that the visualization does
    poorly, (3) who is controlling the narrative, and (4) does the
    visualization embrace emotion?

Pick two of the following questions:

1.  When data visualization (or "visceralization") embraces emotion and
    embodiment as discussed in the Data Feminism chapter, does the
    representation become a form of art, and how does this affect its
    perception?

2.  In Chapter 3 of Data Feminism, the authors write that "Scientific
    researchers are now proving by experiment what designers and artists
    have known through practice: activating emotion, leveraging
    embodiment, and creating novel presentation forms help people grasp
    and learn more from data-driven arguments, as well as remember them
    more fully" (D'Ignazio and Klein 2020). The practice of data
    visceralization is an example of researchers bridging the gap
    between the arts and the sciences to improve the effectiveness of
    their work. It has long been known that the sciences are
    exclusionary and resist interdisciplinarity. What are some ways that
    you think the arts and humanities can inform the sciences, and how
    can the sciences be more receptive to those ideologies?

3.  How do the ethical considerations for data visualization outlined in
    Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization
    compare to those in the Data Feminism chapter?

4.  In DF Chapter 3, the authors stress the importance of data
    visualization in invoking emotion, but also accurately allowing
    people to grasp and interact with the data, which in many cases
    means including uncertainty in the visualization in some way. What
    could be some downfalls or obstacles that may arise when attempting
    to visualize uncertainty?

5.  In the article "Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative
    Visualization," the authors acknowledge that users can play a
    significant role in the interpretation of a data visualization.
    Using the provided examples of "Mapping America" and "Poll Dancing,"
    explain where differing user interpretations can arise. You can also
    analyze a different data visualization of your own choosing.

6.  The textbook talked about how there is ongoing debate on the merits
    of simplicity vs viscerality in data visualization; at what point is
    data visualization that utilizes emotion misleading or biasing data?
    Is there a way in which visual simplicity could bias a viewer\'s
    understanding of data?

7.  In the \'Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative
    Visualization\' one of the first rhetorics discussed is the
    Information Access Rhetoric. In this rhetoric, they discuss the
    concept of \'omission\'. What is omission, what may it look like,
    and connecting back to previous readings on data cleaning and
    analysis, how might omission be helpful/hurtful in visualizations?

8.  Chapter 3 of Data Feminism discusses the differences between data
    visualization and data visceralization, especially in their relation
    to data accessibility. How are both visualization and
    visceralization able to improve or worsen accessibility of data, and
    in what ways do the differences between the two strategies affect
    this ability?

9.  Designer Mushon Zer-Aviv called data visualization \"the
    unempathetic art\"; in what way could viewing data as being devoid
    of emotion and requiring a lack of empathy be problematic when
    trying to accurately tell a story with data? How much merit is there
    to the idea that data visualizations should be stripped down to
    their most basic parts?

10. In Chapter 3 of Data Feminism, the authors discuss the misconception
    that data visualizations are objective. Instead, they are persuasive
    pieces of media that even in their \"plainest\" or most
    \"unemotional\" form have large impacts and can manipulate viewers\'
    perceptions. If this is the case, how would you build a guideline
    for creating ethical data visualizations? Would you lean into the
    idea that no visualization is truly neutral and create a very
    emotional visualization to make your biases known? or would you aim
    to build something as neutral as possible? Somewhere in between?

11. How do the practices we have discussed in class align or not align
    with the methods of research described in Visualization Rhetoric:
    Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization? In what ways can the
    seven principles of data feminism be seen in these methods?

12. In the current highly polarized political environment, we see
    emotional data visualizations on a daily basis. (On the news, on
    billboards, in advertisements, on social media, etc.) Would you say
    visualization rhetoric has added to the climate? Is creating a story
    within data visualizations helpful for audience understanding, or
    does create more harm than good?
