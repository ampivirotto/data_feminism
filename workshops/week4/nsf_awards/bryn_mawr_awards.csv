The Center plans to integrate resources from higher education, an existing NSF-funded quantum center at the Johns Hopkins University, national labs, and industry to advance research in quantum materials and quantum sensing and to transform education and workforce development. This project is expected to develop new quantum materials and enhance quantum metrology, leading to potential applications with broad societal benefits, such as energy-efficient electronics and enhanced biomedical imaging. The development of atomistic modeling strategies, machine learning, and quantum computing algorithms can significantly benefit other science and engineering fields. The proposed education and workforce development focus on broadening the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) at all levels and developing a pipeline from high school to college to graduate education and industry.<br/><br/>Five researchers and educators from Bryn Mawr College, along with collaborators from Johns Hopkins University, Colorado State University, University of Pennsylvania, and Ursinus College, propose to expand the research scope of the existing Bryn Mawr Nanomaterials and Spintronics Lab and Atomic and Optical Physics Lab and establish a Research and Education Center for Quantum Materials and Sensing at Bryn Mawr College. The Center?s research is built around three highly interlinked thrusts: quantum materials, quantum sensing, and QISE education research. The Center?s research methodology includes closed-loop quantum material design by combining theoretical calculation, atomistic modeling, and experiments; state-of-the-art floating zone crystal growth, thin-film deposition, and nanofabrication methods; synchrotron x-ray techniques and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based quantum metrology; and evidence-based education research and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies.  The Center?s research activities are expected to (1) develop high-quality crystals, thin films, nanodisks, and devices that host nanometer-sized skyrmions with the helicity degree of freedom; (2) advance the NV-qubit based cryogenic nanoscale spatial mapping of spin structures; (3) enhance understanding of fundamental magnetic properties of centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, covalent 2D magnets, and magnetic nanodisks; (4) provide experimental evidence of the quantum nature of nanoskyrmions and pave the way for building a new type of macroscopic qubit -- skyrmion qubits; and (5) advance QISE education by integrating NLP technologies and developing teaching resources with paired assessment tools for undergraduate and K-12 education.<br/><br/>This Award is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program. This project is also co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

In this project, the PI will examine such problems in the realm of commutative algebra through the study of minimal free resolutions of ideals in a polynomial ring. Specifically, the PI will focus on monomial ideals, which are key to understanding the structure of any ideal, a central topic in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The second part of this project is the study of parking functions, a concept originating in computer science. The PI will examine two novel variations of parking functions: Stirling permutations and tiered parking functions. The last part of this project is the PI?s ongoing work ""Meet a Mathematician,"" a video series aimed at broadening the participation of historically excluded and underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The PI?s work on monomial ideals will focus on their algebraic invariants that arise from minimal free resolutions. Specifically, the PI will investigate algebraic invariants of monomial ideals associated to graphs and express these invariants in terms of combinatorial data of graphs. The PI?s work on parking functions will focus on developing a framework to study Stirling permutations and tiered parking functions. A special focus will be given to the enumeration of these parking functions and the geometry of their associated polytopes. Lastly, the PI will work on initiatives related to ""Meet a Mathematician,? with the goal of broadening participation in the mathematical sciences from local to international levels.

The real-time, detailed analysis of student learning through qualitative and quantitative data analysis enables educators and administrators to understand how each learner, class, grade, and school is progressing in their learning. By contrast to more summative, end-of-course or end-of-year assessments which offer limited or delayed insights on student learning, this project provides educators and learners with access to deep analysis of student learning to make systemic course corrections and enable teachers to identify which standards and skills student's have been mastered and which need additional support in support of a more holistic approach to assessment and learning in primary and secondary education.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the effects targeted large language model (LLM) fine-tuning using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and natural language processing (NLP) and infinite-context LLM based natural language generation (NLG) on qualitative and quantitative assessments of learners in grades 5-12. This research goal addresses, first, the problem that NLG is being used to generate feedback and content without targeted fine-tuning. There is an opportunity to use PEFT to allow for rapid, individualized NLG. Second, assessment relies on grades and tests that may not capture learning as robustly as necessary for a more holistic assessment mechanisms to make rapid and real-time shifts and provide comprehsive feedback. The technological innovation will use infinite context LLM pipelines and NLP techniques to allow teachers and administrators to gain a more complete view of students? learning over time. This technical innovation will be paired with discourse analysis of collaborating educators and administrators to investigate effects of these novel NLP and NLG technologies on student learning over time. It is anticipated the intervention will provide educators with much greater visibility into distinct learning paths and provide timely feedback to improve K12 education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By examining in-depth the roles of campus administrations, professional organizations, and informal networks that contribute to this process, the project is uniquely positioned to identify barriers and solutions. A pilot study indicates that a few staff in each grant-active PUI perform the same core research development (RD) functions as a much larger and more specialized RD staff at large research universities. Yet, these functions are under extensive strain due to competing priorities and limited resources. <br/><br/>The project team uses recent data from small and large data collections, earlier literature, and expert consultations to develop concise background materials and agendas to better understand the nature and variations of RD among PUIs. By convening a series of regional two-day workshops, approximately 16 participants (per workshop) representative of PUI types and RD personnel, materials will be reviewed and specific ideas and priorities developed. Subsequent public webinars and related channels add to the basis for a report with national recommendations for evidence development, demonstration programs, and evaluation to promote systemic long-term enhancement of the PUI research enterprise. By crystallizing knowledge of unique aspects of PUI RD challenges, promoting strength-based rather than deficit-based modeling of PUI needs, capacities, and growth paths, and broadening the participation of currently less active segments of the PUI universe, the project will provide concrete, independent, expert suggestions on how to enhance national networks of communication and service to more effectively support PUI research activities, thus spreading research experience, knowledge, and resources to new and potentially underserved communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluorine, an element on the periodic table, has risen in prominence over the last several decades, largely due to a host of beneficial properties that it can impart on organic molecules.  This has led to fluorine atoms being introduced to many of the leading pharmaceuticals on the market, often improving the activity of existing drugs while also paving the way for new therapeutics.  Given these important enhancements, the Melvin laboratory has devised a new class of reagents, called sulfone iminium fluorides (SIFs), which are capable of incorporating fluorine in the most efficient and expedient ways possible.  Research plans here aim to expand the utility of SIFs to tackle even more challenging fluorination reactions, such as the formation of critical phosphorus ? fluorine bonds.  Additionally, Dr. Melvin is investigating how this reagent class can be altered to not only improve fluorination reactions, but to also enhance the creation of nitriles, a much sought-after functional group on medicinally relevant organic molecules.  Beyond the laboratory, Dr. Melvin is bringing his research on sulfone iminium fluorides to the classroom in an upper-level, research-inspired laboratory course at Bryn Mawr College.  Finally, to increase chemistry engagement amongst the all-female undergraduate population, Dr. Melvin is developing a week-long ?Nobel Prize-winning Chemistry Tutorial?, which offers students a chance to actively connect with current, cutting-edge science.<br/><br/>In this research, Patrick Melvin of Bryn Mawr College is further probing the influence of sulfone iminium fluorides (SIFs) on various organic methodologies.  Recently, the Melvin laboratory has developed a highly reactive class of SIFs and demonstrated their remarkable propensity for the deoxyfluorination of alcohol and carboxylic acids and their engagement in sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry.  The enhanced reactivity of SIFs leads to rapid and efficient transformations for reactions that have traditionally been challenging and slow.  Using these reagents, the Melvin laboratory is investigating their effectiveness on the synthesis of heteroatom ? fluorine bonds, namely phosphorus-fluorine and sulfur-fluorine bonds, which have a growing importance in both medicinal and synthetic chemistry.  Furthermore, classic deoxyfluorination reactions of carbonyl functional groups will be examined using these reagents with an eye toward circumventing the need for reactive fluoride sources.  Efforts are ongoing to modify the SIF structure to enable external base-free deoxyfluorination reactions, which would further elevate the utility of this methodology.  Finally, the Melvin laboratory is exploring more extensive alterations to the sulfone iminium core structure to employ this reagent class in cyanation reactions via nucleophilic and electrophilic pathways.  This research demonstrates that fluorination methodologies can be significantly improved through careful reagent design and shows real promise for developing new pathways to the installation of important organic functionality; most notably via the crafting of C-F and C-CN bonds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current models suggest that in little more than a century it attracted large numbers of immigrants from elsewhere in the Midcontinent and became the preeminent center in all North America. Drawing on theoretical approaches the project seeks to explore its trajectory of growth as the making of an urban landscape. Yet understanding urbanism requires large-scale spatial data on the growth of such centers in the early years of their development. To address this problem, the research team will perform high-resolution magnetometry over the site. This massive subsurface survey will cover more than 5.5 km2 of  urban landscape, making it the largest such survey ever conducted in the Americas of an archaeological site. This project will provide the first near-total geophysical survey of the subsurface. Data from the magnetometer survey, combined with rigorous GIS and geospatial analyses, will allow us to finally ?see? beneath the surface from a birds-eye view, thus affording an unparalleled opportunity to compare  growth with other early cases of urban formation around the world. This project will include not only the first site-wide map of the buried landscape but will also provide insights into the ways that Indigenous peoples coalesced to form the largest precolonial community in the US. The investigation will also provide a dataset of incalculable value for future planning at the site which is visited by a quarter-million visitors each year. After the project, these data will be made available to other scholars and students via the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) and a web portal hosted by the University of Michigan. The digital atlas will become the basis for future investigations within the site?s central core, forming a foundation for multi-year research projects, Ph.D. dissertations and M.A. theses, and even projects through which middle and high school students learn GIS techniques while exploring America?s first city. Through consultation with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (SHPO), and across Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs), the project also promises sustained collaboration with Indigenous tribes who claim the site as an ancestral homeland. This will ensure that the opportunity and responsibility to serve as stakeholders in stewardship of these sensitive data are widely shared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These economically and ecologically important hard reef structures will soon be replaced by softer assemblages of microbes, algae, and sponges.  The fossil record of reefs can provide critical insights that allow for predictions about how reef environments transition away from microbial-algal-sponge structures to robust reefs built by skeletonized animals like corals.  This project will investigate such a transition during the Ordovician Period by quantifying trends in reef-builders through time.  The ecologic impact of the fossil reefs will be compared to that of modern coral reefs to help make predictions about how modern reef environments will function without robustly-skeletonized reef-builders.  The products of this work will greatly advance the career of two Latinx geoscientists who teach at predominantly undergraduate institutions.  This work will expose ninety first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students to the study of reefs and will involve six to twelve FGLI students in mentored research experiences.<br/><br/>This project will quantify framework builders in reefs of the Early-Middle Ordovician succession near Ibex, Utah using a combination of outcrop, petrographic, and geochemical techniques.  A specific aim of this work is to develop geochemical techniques for uncovering the presence of cryptic microbialite fabrics, particularly in mud-mounds.  Another aim is to detail how the combined reef mounds within a given interval act as a larger reef unit with respect to impacts on the depositional system.  This work will include summer field and laboratory research conducted by FGLI undergraduates participating in two programs at Bryn Mawr College: the STEM Posse and STEMLA Fellows programs.  Each summer, research mentees will work with the PI to present short courses on the study of fossil reefs to incoming cohorts of the two programs.

Over its six-year duration, this project will fund 4-year scholarships to 45 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biochemistry, biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer sciences, and geology. In the summer before their first semester, these students will join the STEMLA Fellows Program (STEM and the Liberal Arts at Bryn Mawr), a program that supports low-income students interested in STEM. The project activities aim to enhance persistence of STEMLA through STEM-career-focused mentoring and additional opportunities leading to graduation. The effectiveness of a residential STEM summer program that focuses on the application of foundational STEM skills to real-world problems and promotes cohort development through shared experiences and near-peer mentorship will also be studied. Additional project activities designed to promote retention will continue until graduation and include summer internships, shadowing opportunities, professional society membership, support for conference attendance, STEM curricular support and GRE preparation. As part of the STEM career pathway mentorship provided to participants, the project will also assess current practices in STEM mentorship and generate guides for effective ways faculty can cultivate students? interests in academia and industry, helping them build a pathway to a successful future in a STEM occupation. Additionally, the project will build mentorship guidelines for field and laboratory research experiences that are responsive to the unique needs of low-income students. Importantly, these guides will be disseminated locally and nationally, via workshops and publications, and program features will be replicable at other institutions. The study of how these opportunities affect self-efficacy, STEM identity, and belonging in STEM will also contribute to the general understanding of factors that encourage persistence in STEM for low-income students. Because Bryn Mawr College is a women?s college, this project has the potential to broaden participation of low-income women in the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project will accomplish this goal by increasing supports that foster STEM identity, self-efficacy, and belonging among low-income students. The project will (1) test the long-term effectiveness of a residential summer program for incoming STEMLA Fellows on their decisions to pursue STEM majors and careers; (2) assess current practices in the mentoring of STEM majors and promote effective ways faculty can cultivate Fellows? career interests inside and outside academia, (3) develop mentorship guidelines on inclusive practices in bench science and create a faculty training module that will equip faculty to design and lead safe, inclusive field experiences, and (4) expand activities that increase retention in STEM majors and help Fellows ideate pathways to STEM careers. The Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) framework examines psychosocial factors that influence how individuals, including women and people from low-income and underrepresented populations, make decisions to pursue or discontinue STEM education and career pursuits. One key domain identified by SCCT that influences persistence in STEM is STEM self-efficacy belief, or an individual?s belief that they can accomplish STEM tasks. Activities in this project specifically target domains known to enhance self-efficacy and provide opportunities for students to cultivate a strong sense of personal identity in STEM. This project will evaluate the effects that STEMLA?s mentorship supports have on psychosocial determinants of persistence in STEM via a longitudinal study. Additional evaluation will examine the effects of the program on academic performance and graduation rate. Outcomes of this project include academic performance of Fellows that is on-par with their not-low-income peers, a strong sense of STEM identity, self-efficacy, and belonging, and persistence in STEM through graduation. Finally, the development of guiding principles in inclusive strategies in STEM career mentorship, lab mentorship and field work, in addition to the efficacy data generated by the study of these interventions, will be disseminated to the K-16 community via workshops, and publications. Importantly, these outputs will provide a framework for other colleges and universities to effect institutional transformation that seeks to empower women and low-income students to belong, thrive, and persist in STEM careers. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

Most notable are the effects of environmental conditions on the seasonal onset and duration of flowering.  The timing of flowering within and among species is important for the persistence of natural populations because it affects interactions between plants, and the availability of flowers and fruits for the animals that depend on them.  But the effects of environmental change on flowering differ among species and regions. This project aims to understand and forecast changes in flowering and fruiting among thousands of different plant species across the continental U.S.A. This project takes full advantage of millions of observations of flowering times collected by scientists working with the National Ecological Observation Network  (NEON) and citizen-scientists contributing observations from their homes, neighborhoods, and public lands to the  National Phenology Network (NPN).  The researchers will augment these records of flowering times with the data from millions more herbarium specimens that are available on-line to detect the responses of flowering times to the past century of climate change.  These observations will be combined with soil quality, plant cover, land use history, climate, and disturbance data to better understand how different environmental conditions influence species-specific and regional flowering times. Finally, the researchers will use statistical models to forecast short and long-term changes in future flowering times. The combined dataset will be a valuable resource available to other researchers examining the effects of environmental change on plant species and community traits. In addition, the research will provide educational opportunities for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. The project will also engage citizen-scientists who will contribute to a database of flowering times observed from herbarium collections through the CrowdCurio crowdsourcing platform.<br/><br/>Plant phenology?the seasonal timing of key developmental events?is essential for species? reproductive success. However, critical gaps remain in our understanding of phenology across space, time, and taxa. Increasingly, online herbaria and associated data are being mobilized to address these knowledge gaps because they provide extensive data that can be used to detect phenological responses to climatic change within and among biomes, functional groups, and taxonomic groups. In this project, the standardized, replicated, and focused phenological observations provided by NEON and the USA National Phenology Network will be harmonized for the first time with the taxonomic, spatial, and geographic breadth of herbarium data. First, flowering times derived from herbarium specimens will be assembled and augmented to include > 4400 plant species that collectively span much of the continental US, with specific attention to key regions that have been digitized but overlooked: prairie, alpine, and urban biomes. Second, sources of variation in phenology within and among species, geographic regions, and higher taxa, and the effects of numerous understudied extrinsic factors (e.g., fire history, soil quality, disturbance) will be modeled. Third, forecasts of near- and long-term changes in the phenological behavior of populations, species, and communities will be modeled to better understand phenological responses at multiple ecological, phylogenetic, and temporal scales. Collectively, these efforts will help to elucidate plausible mechanistic responses to climatic and geographic factors that will determine species? future phenology.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Environmental Biology/Macrosystems Biology and NEON-enabled Science Program and the Division of Biological Infrastructure/Capacity: Cyberinfrastructure Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to study how evolutionary responses of an ecologically dominant plant to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and nitrogen enrichment influence the flow of carbon into and out of coastal marsh ecosystems.  The researchers plan to leverage a long-term experiment to characterize how plant traits that impact photosynthesis, the decomposition of organic matter in marsh sediments, and sediment accretion shift in response to increased carbon dioxide and nitrogen availability.  They then plan to establish the underlying genetic basis for these traits, so that changes in genetic variation can be used to confirm that evolution has taken place.  And finally, the researchers plan to quantify the consequences of changes in traits, and their associated genetic variation, for long-term carbon storage in, or loss from, highly productive marsh ecosystems.  This would enable the researchers to identify mechanistic and functional links between plant evolution and carbon cycling in coastal marshes, which face an uncertain future due to anticipated sea-level rise. Findings from this research have the potential to improve our understanding of the global carbon budget, and to foster more effective coastal restoration by advancing our understanding of marsh persistence.  Furthermore, the project can strengthen research infrastructure, create new educational and outreach opportunities, including the engagement of citizen scientists, and facilitate undergraduate research by students from groups underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>This project employs a complementary set of studies explicitly designed to bridge evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology. Using a combination of new experiments and tissue archives from an ongoing, long-term global change experiment, the researchers plan to simultaneously assay in situ genetic and genomic variation using ddRAD-generated SNPs, to characterize functional trait (e.g. maximum rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency) variation in the field, and to quantify complete marsh carbon budgets (e.g. quantifying NPP, gaseous C losses, litter decomposition rate, and belowground biomass and C accumulation).  These measurements are set in the context of more than a decade of exposure to elevated CO2 and nitrogen enrichment. To go beyond establishing associations between traits, genetic variation, and carbon flux post hoc, the researchers plan to conduct a complementary de novo quantitative genetics study of trait variation and physiology, with the intent of linking both to carbon fluxes mediated by individual plants. Establishing such mechanistic links can improve parameterization of a mechanistic model of C cycling in coastal marshes, enabling a more thorough characterization of ecosystem-level consequences of organismal evolution. Findings from this project can illustrate whether organismal evolution is an important determinant of how ecosystems function and offer new insights about how global change can directly and indirectly alter ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, organ transplants need to be stored at ultralow temperatures. Fuel cells used for power generation often operate at very high temperatures, with specialized gases. The design of advanced materials and systems across many industries requires a better understanding of the biological and chemical processes involved. This demands testing environments that closely mimic real process conditions, which is an enormous challenge. The acquisition of a confocal Raman microscope with sophisticated environmental control will enable in vivo chemical mapping under a wide temperature range and different gas/liquid environments. This instrument will facilitate cutting-edge research and education projects across four research areas-nanomaterials, bioengineering, thermal and chemical engineering, and collaboration among three institutions-Villanova University, Bryn Mawr College, and Cabrini University. Moreover, the instrument will support a range of integrated research and education projects and provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. This facility will also be integrated into three K-12 outreach activities with an expected enrollment of over 500 under-represented students. <br/><br/>With a temperature range of -196 to about 1000°C and controlled gas/liquid environments, the confocal Raman microscope can provide high resolution and real-time structural and chemical fingerprints of materials and chemicals. Raman spectroscopy has a unique compatibility with aqueous or high temperature, particularly suited for biological and high temperature characterizations. Seven projects will be enabled at three institutions. They include investigations on solid oxide fuel cells to provide important insight into fuel reaction mechanisms, two dimensional materials to promote new synthetic methods and understanding of their structure-property relations under extreme conditions, energy storage materials for high-performance energy storage systems, spin-phonon coupling in multiferroic oxides to provide unprecedented evidence for the mechanism of multiferroicity, molecular mechanisms of cryo-injury for developing cell preservation technologies, molecular properties of intact drosophila hearts to provide insights on physiological aging. By addressing all these needs, the proposed instrument will greatly advance knowledge and promote interdisciplinary research in nanomaterials, thermal and chemical engineering, and bioengineering/biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Normal patterns of mammalian growth and development are perturbed if the expression of imprinted genes is dysregulated. This research focuses on DNA methylation, which plays a leading role in directing differential expression of the mother?s vs. the father?s copy of imprinted genes. This project will examine the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation at imprinted genes, in order to better understand how distribution of this DNA modification on the two parental copies results in different expression patterns. These studies will be conducted at Bryn Mawr College, a women?s undergraduate institution, and will provide a diverse cohort of students the opportunity to advance scientific exploration, expand their data science literacy and prepare them to be the next generation of research scientists.<br/><br/>While stable parental allele-specific differences in DNA methylation are inherited via gametes and modulate the expression of imprinted genes, less is known about the acquisition and maintenance of highly variable DNA methylation profiles at secondary differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that maintain imprinted expression patterns at individual loci. This research will provide insight into the mechanisms that govern establishment and maintenance of epigenetic profiles at secondary DMRs. An oxidative bisulfite approach will be used to examine 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) content to test the hypothesis that hemimethylation at secondary DMRs is a consequence of 5hmC enrichment and leads to loss of methylation and pattern variability. Furthermore, the high level of hemimethylation observed at secondary DMRs suggests that maintenance of methylation at these sequences may be a complex process. The role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) at secondary DMRs will be investigated by analysis of DNA methylation patterns in mice bearing a Dnmt1 mutation that has different effects at global genomic sequences vs. imprinted loci. The experiments will test the hypothesis that maintenance of methylation at secondary DMRs may depend on methylation at gametic DMRs and may require Dnmt3.

It is important for society to understand these environmental issues because they impact natural resources needed to sustain life on Earth. One of the biggest challenges in gaining knowledge about how the non-living and living world works is that most research in environmental science has been done at small, local scales, but many current environmental issues operate at regional, continental, and global scales. Thus, scaling up environmental research across space is vital. Macrosystems biology seeks to understand research on biosphere processes and their complex interactions with climate, land use, and changes in species geographic distributions at regional to continental scales. Such large-scale scientific research demands a collaborative team of scientists, including individuals with the ability to integrate across disciplinary and cultural differences, so that insights made are of the highest scientific quality and are socially equitable. Given the collaborative nature of macrosystems biology, advances in this field are made through shared knowledge of the science and of how to promote productive, diverse teams. This meeting will promote knowledge sharing by providing an opportunity for researchers to share insights into macrosystems biology advances and into team science. Through professional development and engagement of a diverse group of scientists, collaboration of active researchers, and generation of new ideas and synthesis of research projects, this meeting will broaden the impact of currently funded Macrosystems biology research. Specific efforts will be made to emphasize perspectives of early-career and traditionally under-represented researchers in all aspects of the workshop.<br/><br/>This conference proposal will support a meeting of project scientists funded through the NSF Macrosystems Biology and National Ecological Observatory Network Enabled Science (MSB-NES) program. The meeting?s theme will be team science with emphases on inclusion and access. The meeting will advance macrosystems biology and NEON enabled science through four goals: 1) facilitating networking and community-building among a diverse group of MSB-NES researchers; 2) reflect on the first ten years of MSB research and outline knowledge gaps to be addressed in the next decade; 3) providing training on team science in a diverse landscape for MSB-NES researchers that will help teams to successfully broaden participation; and 4) identifying aspects of team science that promote open science and inclusion to make accessible insights from MSB-NES research teams to a wide audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geographic patterns of biodiversity are expected to be influenced by a combination of local biological factors, like competition among species, and by regional to continental physical factors, such as climate. However, this expectation has not been evaluated from local to continental scales across diverse species lineages. In addition, natural and human-made disturbances are likely to alter this expectation. This study uses the geographic design of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) across the USA to test this idea, by quantifying multiple biological and physical factors affecting biodiversity patterns of small mammals, fish, and ground beetles at nested spatial scales. The study will add new, publicly available data to NEON including measures of animal body sizes, species diversity, and geospatial layers for disturbance and land use histories, climate, geology, and topography. Teaching modules will highlight data science skills needed to work with NEON data. Undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs will engage directly with the research. The study will also engage the public and increase awareness of the biosphere and environmental change with an interactive exhibit for Science on a Sphere developed with computer science students, a natural history museum, and a large science festival.<br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the field of ecology by connecting fine-grained measurements of individual organism traits, like body size, to cross-scale drivers of biodiversity from plot to continental scales. This research develops a conceptual framework that describes relationships among intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in body size, biodiversity, and drivers related to disturbance, past land use, and their interactions. This framework will advance basic theory and prediction of spatial biodiversity patterns by linking ITV to drivers of biodiversity across scales. Three main questions include: (1) How does spatial scale influence body size ITV and its relationship with biodiversity across taxa within NEON? (2) How is disturbance regime explained by different scales of climate, geodiversity and land cover, and past land use across NEON? (3) How do relationships among climate, geodiversity and land cover, past land use, disturbance regime, and body size ITV explain variation in biodiversity across taxa from local to continental scales? The proposed research will meet a major research need within NEON, to quantify disturbance and land use history data from the plot to the domain scale. Such data are essential to interpretation of observational ecological data and will be publicly disseminated as a geospatial and tabular database containing code for linking other NEON plot, site, and domain data products. These new data and biodiversity analyses will serve to establish a baseline for future spatiotemporal NEON data products that concern ecological communities and ITV.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On curved spaces with a rich set of arithmetic symmetries (arithmetic manifolds), the role of these building blocks closely attuned to their geometry, dynamics, and the underlying algebraic structure is played by cusp forms. This project will investigate the extreme oscillating behavior and geometric impact of non-spherical cusp forms, and the distribution of families of cusp forms within natural ambient spaces.

From an analytic perspective, cusp forms are joint eigenfunctions of invariant differential operators including the Laplacian, whose long-term/large-scale analytic behavior (such as their size) should reflect the spectral geometry and chaotic dynamics on arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds. The PI will leverage the trace formula, geometry of numbers, and explicit inversion to study such analytic properties of non-spherical cusp forms. Cusp forms naturally occur in families, and it is of central interest to identify the size of a family in expanding and shrinking regions of adelic parameters (generalizing Weyl's law, originally formulated by physicists) and their distribution including symmetry type.

It centers around a plasma wind-tunnel experiment in which turbulent plasma is generated and launched down a cylindrical column. Measurements of this plasma will be used to better understand the characteristics of plasma turbulence and to compare it to conventional fluid and air turbulence.

High spatial resolution of access ports along the chamber will allow for many simultaneous direct measurements of fluctuating fields, flows, plasma density and temperature. Experimental goals include evaluation and study of the turbulence that is generated as well as establishing this flowing turbulent plasma as an environment in which to study other phenomena - much like the flowing air in a conventional wind-tunnel is used to study aerodynamics. Plans include observations of changes in turbulence in the presence of magnetic dipoles or insulating obstacles, as well as modifications due to injection of energetic particles or waves. Within a controllable laboratory setting, the program seeks to better understand the state of plasma that is observed throughout the solar system - magnetized, turbulent, and fully three-dimensional.

Through a series of five conferences over fourteen months, this cohesive, focused professional development series will convene approximately 100 Noyce pre- and in-service secondary STEM teachers, and other Philadelphia-area STEM teachers.  Through the conference activities, these participants will gain the understanding and skills needed to ""Integrate STEM in Everyday Life,"" the primary theme of the year-long work.

Educators will be supported in thinking intentionally about areas of their students' lives in which learning STEM concepts would be highly motivating.  Examples of such areas include sports, food and nutrition, health and safety, music, and transportation.  The workshop participants will design and develop learning experiences that engage their students in exploring how STEM concepts and practices intersect with language arts, history, and fine arts, as well as how STEM affects their lives and influences their decisions.  In this conference series, teachers will be challenged to develop engaging place-based, project-based units that not only align with the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards, but also to place STEM teaching in socio-scientific and cultural contexts.  In addition to the member institutions of the PRNP, this project will reach out to institutions of higher education in the Philadelphia region who have not had Noyce programs and introduce students and faculty from these institutions to the Noyce network.  Furthermore, the project will disseminate what is learned through this work in publications and presentations at national professional meetings.  This project has the potential to advance instructional skills of teachers in developing and implementing placed-based curricular units that use the surrounding communities as their laboratories.  Thus, learning environments can be extended from inside school walls into the community, while simultaneously bringing cultural and community stakeholders into the world of schools.  This interchange has the potential to open new relationships within each community along STEM, cultural, and community lines.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interaction is key to the formation of magnetic structures that have potential as a new means to store and transmit information, and it also leads to unusual modifications of the properties of magnetic materials, important for future devices. The research teams at Bryn Mawr College and Colorado State University are taking a collaborative approach to study magnetic interactions and magnetization dynamics in order to gain new insight into the underlying physics of the interaction effects. Education for the young generation is an important component of this project. The PIs strive to involve and train students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, especially women and students from underrepresented minority groups. The students working on this project also have the opportunity to collaborate with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory and gain hands on imaging experience. The PIs incorporate research examples from this project into teaching and outreach activities at both institutions. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) that lead to anisotropic exchange effects are rapidly gaining attention in magnetism and spintronics-related research. DMI, which arise from broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling, can occur in bulk chiral crystals and at non-magnetic/magnetic interfaces if the non-magnetic layer exhibits high spin orbit coupling. DMI promote the formation of stable chiral magnetic spin configurations such as skyrmions, and significantly modify dynamic processes in thin film systems. It has been shown that DMI can influence skyrmion and domain wall motion and that DMI lead to a nonreciprocity for surface spin waves in extended thin films. DMI should also significantly modify the dynamics in patterned magnetic nanostructures where the wavelengths of the spin dynamics are inherently short due to geometric confinement effects. In this collaborative research project, the research teams are investigating the effects of interfacial DMI on skyrmion formation and on spin dynamics in both extended and patterned multilayered films. Multilayers provide a means to stabilize submicron-sized skyrmions at room temperature by tuning not only DMI and surface anisotropies through the choice of the materials, but also the magnetostatic interactions through varying the number of repeats. The results of this project lead to new information on interfacial DMI and the effects of DMI on skyrmion formation and spin dynamics in confined geometries."

Haskell is used by researchers and programmers in industry to build a variety of software  systems, such as financial analysis tools, interactive websites, data visualizations, and automated vehicle software. Dependent types are an up-and-coming technology that allows programmers to avoid bugs in their software, allowing them to include mathematical proofs of correctness in their code. These proofs are checked before the software ever runs, ruling out the possibility of failures, such as a crashed website. The intellectual merits are insights into the integration of advanced mathematical theories with an industrial-strength development tool (Haskell) and a deeper understanding of the mathematical principles that underlie the creation of correct software. The project's broader significance and importance are to give the technology industry access to dependent types for the first time, while creating opportunities for students (including those at one principal investigator's undergraduate women's college) to engage with this technology.<br/><br/>The project includes both practical and foundational components. The  Haskell type system, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) version 8.0, is able to simulate dependent types through the use of many language extensions. However, this use requires awkward encodings, and the extensions that support them complicate the language. In contrast, the Haskell type system envisioned by this project is based on a uniform approach to dependently typed programming that subsumes prior extensions. Part of this project involves replacing the core language of GHC with one based on dependent type theory, using relevance annotations to ensure that these extensions are backwards compatible. Furthermore, the project also introduces matchable functions, a qualifier that determines whether function applications can be analyzed via pattern matching, enabling the integration of dependent types with GHC's current type inference algorithm.  Finally, this project includes an examination of the semantics of dependently typed programming languages with partiality."

Participants will use a learning community structure to design, implement, and assess sustainability themed STEM curricula that incorporate place-based instruction and use school facilities as living laboratories. The pilot will make use of the resources available in the STEM sustainability ecosystem. Lessons learned on how to develop a regional STEM ecosystem that successfully engages a wide range of stakeholders to support a large urban school district's innovative curricular initiative will be of value to other urban regions in the country.

In addition, some organisms can adapt to changes in their environments within just one generation without any change in their genes.  Such ""developmental plasticity"" occurs when the environment influences how organisms develop, and allows organisms to adapt to environmental challenges more rapidly than is possible through evolutionary change.  Plasticity itself has evolved through the longer process of mutation and selection, but little is known about this evolution. This project focuses on aphids, small insects that reproduce clonally and give live birth during the summer months. The summer form, however, cannot survive a cold winter.  In the fall, when mother aphids sense that days are getting shorter, they chemically signal their embryonic offspring to develop into a form that can lay eggs that can survive the cold temperatures of winter and hatch in the spring.  The participants in this project will investigate the molecular changes that occur in developing aphid embryos when they switch from the summer to the fall form.  Participants will also investigate aphids from regions with mild winters that no longer produce the fall form and do not lay eggs, to try to understand how the response to shorter days has been lost over the course of recent evolution.  The work will take place primarily at Bryn Mawr College, a women's undergraduate institution, and thus also aims to engage young women in the design and execution of hypothesis-driven experimentation and data analysis within the discipline of evolutionary developmental biology.<br/><br/>The aphid reproductive polyphenism is poised to become an important example of genetic accommodation in natural populations, one for which a good deal is known about the developmental and endocrine basis of the plasticity.  Such progress, however, will require an accurate understanding of the fundamentals of the system.  Although several lines of evidence suggest that juvenile hormone is involved in the photoperiod response, the precise role this hormone plays in mediating the effect is not clear.  A combined approach of hormone manipulation, measurements of juvenile hormone titer, and gene expression during early specification and subsequent differentiation into the summer and fall forms will discriminate among competing hypotheses for the role that juvenile hormone plays in the process.  If successful, the experiments could demonstrate an embryonic role for juvenile hormone in the specification of reproductive fate and identify other early markers of this differentiation, providing candidates and opening new doors toward understanding the switch and how it evolves to accommodate novel environments."

This project will prove analytic results about certain special values of L-functions and sums of the values of Dirichlet characters, and it will specifically investigate the impact of the underlying modulus being composed of many smaller factors on these results and on the tools available to prove them. As a prototype of the other class of objects to be studied, signals and motions (such as light waves or vibrations of a string) are often much better understood when viewed as combinations, or superpositions, of simple periodic motions. The wave-like functions that analogously serve as building blocks of analysis on other spaces are known as eigenfunctions and are central in disciplines ranging from spectral geometry to quantum mechanics. This project will investigate the behavior of rapidly oscillating eigenfunctions on spaces with a rich set of symmetries that are arithmetic in nature, in particular how pronounced are their extreme values.<br/><br/>This research project centers around two principal themes, that of extremal behavior of high-energy eigenfunctions on arithmetic manifolds and that of the depth and smooth aspects in analytic number theory. On certain arithmetic manifolds with a specific geometric and functorial structure, the joint eigenfunctions (Hecke--Maass eigenforms) exhibit power growth, which is neither generically expected nor predicted by physical models. The PI will seek out extremal growth and investigate in detail the sup-norm and restriction norm problems on several specific classes of arithmetic manifolds to inform general conjectures and understanding of the phenomenon of concentration of mass on arithmetic manifolds, the precise structure that drives it, and its place within the framework of the correspondence principle of quantum mechanics. In number-theoretic problems involving characters and automorphic forms of large level, the depth and smooth aspects, which are concerned with highly powerful or factorable conductors, play a very distinctive role. The structural impact of the powerful or factorable structure on nonvanishing, subconvexity, and moments of L-functions, as well as exponential sums involving p-adically analytic fluctuations will be studied using non-archimedean analysis, analytic number theory, and spectral theory."

Folds are studied to investigate mountain building, to understand the engineering properties of rock, to predict the underground movement of water or hydrocarbons, and to give insight into the fundamental processes of folding itself.  These applications rely on the accurate interpretation of rock deformation within a fold.  Various conceptual and mathematical models predict fold-related deformation.  To assess the capabilities of such predictive models, data from natural examples are required.  This can be challenging, because most geologic folds at Earth's surface are only partially exposed, with major portions of the fold either buried underground or eroded away.  The Whaleback Anticline in Bear Valley, east-central Pennsylvania, is a unique locale where a complete large-scale fold is exposed; strip mining for coal early in the last century revealed it in exquisite detail.  This outstanding exposure permits observation of the complete three-dimensional form of the folded surface and provides a highly detailed record of deformation across the fold.  This project will use cutting-edge digital imaging techniques and traditional geologic fieldwork to produce a comprehensive data set against which to test hypotheses about folding.  In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the research is contributing to achievement of societally relevant outcomes in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, including the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through graduate and undergraduate student training; the development of research infrastructure of three universities; the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in science; and increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology. The Whaleback Anticline is an important educational field trip location for dozens of university geology departments throughout the eastern United States, and it is a well-used recreation site for the local community. As part of this proposed project we will preserve, expand and curate geological observations from the Whaleback, for use by researchers, educators and the community. <br/><br/>Deformation associated with folding is recorded by distributed strain and discrete secondary structures.  These features are of fundamental importance to understanding mechanisms and sequence of fold evolution and are of practical importance as records and hosts for fluid migration in and around folds.  Incomplete data from natural examples limits the ability to evaluate geometric and physics-based models of folding.  Recent advances in digital imaging and analysis now make it possible to produce quantitative three-dimensional descriptions of noncylindrical folds and evaluate the relationships of these forms to the distribution and evolution of fold-related strain. This project has the following objectives:  1) to produce a high-resolution digital surface model of an iconic fold, the Whaleback Anticline in Bear Valley, east-central Pennsylvania; 2) to document the spatial variability of strain around the fold with new observations of grain-scale strain, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, and detailed mapping of mesoscale structures in the folded layer; 3) to test the hypothesis that surface curvature controls the spatial variation and style of observed strain around a fold; 4) to evaluate stratigraphic and rheological influences on fold strain, through finite element analysis; 5) to demonstrate the utility of structure-from-motion photogrammetry as a tool for structural geology research and 6) to produce educational resources that will preserve and expand access to a world-class field locality and engage the local community."

This project aims to investigate the mechanisms that ultimately allow one copy of these imprinted genes to be expressed while the other copy remains silent, or non-functional. Understanding the regulation of these genes is important because normal patterns of mammalian growth and development are perturbed if the expression of imprinted genes is dysregulated, as when both or neither copy is expressed. These studies will be conducted at Bryn Mawr College, a women's undergraduate institution, and will provide a diverse cohort of undergraduate students with an enhanced educational environment by affording them the opportunity to use current methodologies to advance scientific exploration, ultimately preparing these undergraduate women to be the next generation of research scientists.<br/><br/>Imprinted genes are only expressed from one of the two parentally inherited alleles. Monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is associated with differential DNA methylation on the maternal and paternal alleles that are passed to offspring at fertilization.  What remains unknown is how further refinement of chromatin structure is achieved during post-fertilization development in order to maintain imprinted expression and establish tissue-specific imprinting. Post-fertilization acquisition of DNA methylation at additional sites within imprinted loci has been proposed to serve this purpose, but DNA methylation at such secondary differentially methylated regions is highly variable. This research will test the hypotheses that the observed variability is due to increased levels of hemi-methylation and/or increased levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. In addition, this work will identify cis-regulatory elements responsible for tissue-specific imprinting using chromosome conformation capture to understand how these elements work in concert with epigenetic factors to achieve monoallelic vs. biallelic expression. Overall, this research will lend insight into the mechanisms governing the establishment and maintenance of chromatin structure critical for imprinted gene expression."

This award will support participants at two scientific symposia. The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) is a society of scientists dedicated to fostering the success of Hispanic/Chicano and Native American scientists from college students to professionals to attain advanced degrees, careers, and positions of leadership in science. One way SACNAS strives to achieve their goals is through their annual National Conference, whose programming includes scientific symposia sessions featuring talks by members of the scientific research community. The purpose of these sessions is to present research from diverse disciplines, share advanced research and discoveries, interact with attendees, and mentor science students. As part of this special program the PIs will organize scientific symposia in the mathematical sciences; specifically, they will organize three sessions dealing with research in abstract algebra at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate level. These scientific symposia sessions address a variety of broader impacts. First, by organizing these sessions during one of the nations largest conferences for Hispanics and Native Americans, the PIs will reach students and professionals from traditionally underrepresented groups in academia. These participants will have the opportunity to see and contribute to current mathematical research presented at the 2015 SACNAS National Conference. In addition, conference participants will be able to hear from mathematicians who have mentored and advised students in numerous mathematical research projects; hence giving participants an opportunity to hear about possible research projects and meet new mentors and/or advisers. <br/><br/>The undergraduate session, ""Abstract Algebra research topics for undergraduates,"" will introduce algebra research topics that are accessible to students with a post-calculus background. Emphasis will be placed on providing a wide range of interesting problems so to encourage undergraduates to continue their studies and motivate them to pursue further research and work in mathematics. The graduate session, ""On my way to becoming an algebraist"" will invite underrepresented graduate students to present research talks, thus providing them with a venue to present their scholarly work, network with other researchers, and gain the opportunity for collaboration and furthering their current projects. The postgraduate session, ""Algebra: much more than arithmetic"" will introduce cutting edge mathematical research done by mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as provide a venue to meet and interact with researchers interested in mentoring underrepresented students in mathematics. The design of the sessions include four speakers per scientific symposia, allowing for 12 talks with topics in abstract algebra at a wide range of mathematical levels. By providing mathematical talks at a wide range of mathematical levels, the sessions aim to increase interest among conference attendees. In addition, at least 75% of presenters in each session will be from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.  The conference website is http://sacnas.org/events/national-conf"

The Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership will develop a model of early career teacher support using regional resources that will retain and sustain new STEM teachers.  These new Noyce teachers will have increased opportunities to participate in mentoring, professional development, communities of practice and social networks with regional STEM professionals in real and virtual environments. The new teacher support model will include the following components: (1) Individualized Support Plan (ISP); (2) Mentoring (Mentor Training Model Development, Mentor Training and Mentoring Support); (3) Professional Development; (4) Outreach and Networking; and (5) Website Based Resources and Communication.<br/><br/>The proposed activities will contribute to the subfield within STEM education focused on preparing,retaining, and supporting the development of high quality teachers in high needs settings.

By the end of the two-year project, there will be a refined regional model of new STEM teacher support that can be scaled to provide support for large numbers of new teachers. In addition to providing support for new STEM teachers working in high-needs schools in Philadelphia, to  increase their capacities as teachers and the likelihood that they will stay in teaching, the project will prepare experienced STEM teachers to serve as mentors of new teachers, enhancing the self-sustaining capacity of the network of teachers in Philadelphia. The project will strengthen a growing partnership across seven teacher education institutions in Philadelphia, facilitating regional cooperation efforts devoted to teacher development and support. Finally, through collaborative efforts, the partnership will offer a rich menu of supports for all new STEM teachers in the region, exceeding the capacity of any single institution to support its graduates."

Through this MRI award, Bryn Mawr College will acquire instrumentation that will allow researchers and educators to provide undergraduate women with rigorous and socially relevant independent research experiences in climate and environmental change studies. The instrumentation will also be used to advance faculty research by providing Bryn Mawr College faculty and thesis students the ability to generate high-resolution carbon isotopic data. The acquisition of the proposed instrumentation will allow for higher resolution, less expensive, and timelier analysis of carbon isotopic data for active research programs such as: investigating changes in ancient ocean conditions and their relationships to mass extinctions and the implications of nitrogen pollution and elevated greenhouse gas concentrations on invasive species and ecosystem services in tidal wetlands. This will ultimately help train a more scientifically literate work force and will provide aspiring women scientists with analytical skills that are very much in-demand. The instrumentation will directly improve the research opportunities for undergraduate women at Bryn Mawr College by providing in-house analytical capabilities. The instrumentation will also be an integral component in summer and semester programming for the two Bryn Mawr College STEM Posses, each of which is a diverse group of ten aspiring scientists recruited from urban public schools in Boston. Bryn Mawr College's programming for the current STEM Posse has allowed faculty to identify and remedy weaknesses in approaches to diversifying STEM majors. Thus, the instrumentation will ultimately serve to help increase diversity within STEM graduates.<br/><br/>Specifically, this award funds Bryn Mawr College's acquisition of a Picarro Dual Carbon Isotope Analyzer for analysis of the carbon isotopic composition of carbon dioxide and methane, coupled with a Costech Elemental Combustion System. The Picarro Dual Carbon Isotope Analyzer utilizes cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) in order to measure stable isotopes of carbon. Picarro CRDS devices are less expensive and are easier to use and maintain than the isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMS) operated by larger research institutions. This advance in technology allows for stable isotopic analysis to be used for teaching and research in a liberal arts college setting. Because of increased demand among liberal arts college students for applications of science to societal issues, there is a critical need to provide those students with practical experiences performing analyses that are used to study climate and environmental change. The proposed instrumentation will also be used to develop laboratory exercises for introductory, major, and advanced level courses in the Geology and Biology programs. These laboratory exercises will be posted on a website entitled Stable Isotope Science for Undergraduates from which other educators can access teaching plans, visuals and class analysis results. This website will be maintained and updated beyond the life of the proposed project."

Polygonal meshes have become the industry standard for the representation of surfaces with highly complex geometry and arbitrary genus in computer graphics and geometry processing applications. While triangle meshes are the most popular type of mesh representation for surfaces, quadrilateral meshes are better suited than triangle meshes in several applications such as character animation, texture mapping, spline-based surface modeling, mesh compression, and some specific finite element analysis applications. Provably good algorithms for generating triangle meshes from surfaces given by parametric or implicit functions or as point point clouds are widely available. However, algorithms to generate quadrilateral meshes with provable quality guarantees for such surfaces are not as prevalent, in part because the problem of generating a quadrilateral mesh from a given surface is intrinsically harder than its triangular counterpart. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms for quadrilateral meshes for various surface representations with provable guarantees on element quality as measured by commonly used metrics such as angle bounds or aspect ratio, and mesh quality as measured by mesh size or anisotropy. Direct and indirect methods (which generate a quad mesh from a triangle mesh), as well as parameterization guided methods will be utilized. Techniques from computational geometry and graph theory will play a central role in the design and development of algorithms. <br/><br/>The automated generation of provably good quadrilateral meshes for surfaces is a fundamental problem that is of interest both in theory, as it raises several geometric, combinatorial, and graph-theoretic questions, as well as practice, where the computational pipeline from designing a model for the surface to the end stage of simulation or animation is frequently dominated by the meshing process. A formal understanding of these questions is critical not only for the theoretical underpinnings of automated mesh generation, but also for the sound practice of utilizing the meshes in a wide range of applications. <br/><br/>As a collaborative effort between PIs at three undergraduate institutions, involvement of undergraduate students in research projects is an integral part of this project. An important and particular goal for this project is the creation of a larger peer group for female and minority undergraduate Computer Science majors by providing opportunities for collaboration and joint research projects between students across all three institutions. Through early and active involvement of undergraduates in the project, the PIs also seek to create a pipeline of female and minority students bound for graduate school in Computer Science."

The Villanova facility will greatly enhance faculty and student access and allow the overall team to greatly expand their collaborative work. The Villanova facility will feature an ALD system with significantly upgraded capabilities. The system will be faster and feature improved batch operation, allowing the scheduling of a greater volume of work, and feature the ability to do both thermal and plasma deposition. The addition of plasma deposition technology features greater precision and control of the deposition process leading to significantly higher film quality. The plasma deposition process features enhanced nucleation and growth of the films, leading to greater homogeneity and film density. The plasma process also enables the deposition of a much wider variety of thin film materials enabling critical new research areas."

A number of the projects are concrete and easy to explain, and hence appeal to the imagination of a wide mathematical audience. The proposed research is framed by three themes.  The first is a focus on the global properties of the space of Legendrian submanifolds, with specific goals of introducing new quantitative techniques into the study of Lagrangian cobordisms and beginning the study of homotopy groups of spaces of higher dimensional Legendrians.  The second theme seeks to link Legendrian and smooth topology, using the Lagrangian cobordism relation to give meaning to certain quantum knot invariants and the conormal construction to connect Legendrian and smooth invariants.  The final theme emphasizes investigations into the scope and structure of Legendrian invariants, with one project, in particular, poised to uncover a new type of algebraic pattern for Legendrian Contact Homology."

The project will involve the measurement and analysis of faults, folds, and fracture systems; measurements of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility to characterize deformation fabrics; will utilize paleomagnetic analysis to understand how crustal blocks have rotated due to deformation; and will use construction of geological cross-sections utilizing geophysical data. The work will focus on five transects that span the effects of normal to flat-slab subduction, and which cross the thick-skin Sierras Pampeanas, thin-skin Precordillera, and mixed mode Principal Cordillera belts of northwest Argentina. The project will: quantify both vertical-axis rotations and spatial-temporal changes in stress/strain fields across a complex mountain system (thick-skin foreland, thin-skin fold-thrust belt, mixed mode belt); provide a new model for the 3-dimensional kinematic evolution of the region; test geodynamic models that predict different along-strike variations in structural style, stress patterns, rotations, and intraplate shortening rates related to a transition from normal to flat-slab subduction; evaluate effects of crustal rheology, basement weaknesses, and basin inversion on patterns of structural trend, stress refraction, and deformation partitioning; and statistically compare stress/strain directions estimated from fault data, magnetic fabric analysis, earthquake focal mechanisms, and available global positioning satellite data.<br/><br/>Funds to support the international activities associated with this project are being provided by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering."
1354124,Collaborative Research:  Ecosystem Evolution and Sustainability of Nutrient Enriched Coastal Saltmarshes,DEB,ECOSYSTEM STUDIES,3/1/2014,3/22/2016,Thomas Mozdzer,PA,Bryn Mawr College,Continuing Grant,John Schade,2/28/2018,"$174,331.00 ",,tmozdzer@brynmawr.edu,101 N MERION AVE,BRYN MAWR,PA,190102899,6105265496,BIO,118100,"9169, EGCH",$0.00 ,"Overview: Salt marshes provide a broad suite of critical ecosystem services but also face multiple anthropogenic threats including nutrient enrichment and accelerated sea-level rise. Complex interactions between primary production, decomposition, sedimentation, and sea level rise determine the tipping point relative to the rate of sea-level rise beyond which the marsh converted to open water. Nitrate - the dominant form of coastal N-enrichment - acts as both a powerful electron acceptor stimulating microbial decomposition and as a fertilizer stimulating plant growth with the potential to transform saltmarshes through interactive feedbacks in key plant and microbial processes, potentially lowering the tipping point relative to sea-level rise. It is urgent that we understand the impacts of coastal enrichment on saltmarshes in part because of their globally rapid loss, and in part because salt marshes have become the focus of large-scale restoration strategies costing millions to billions of dollars to serve as storm buffers for coastal cities and as ""blue"" carbon pools to mitigate climate change. The TIDE saltmarsh experiment is a unique ecosystem-scale test of how nutrient enrichment affects ecosystem structure, function, and long-term sustainability. Contrary to well-accepted saltmarsh models, TIDE has shown that nutrients can drive saltmarsh loss; however, important questions about causality, and whether geomorphic and ecosystem function will continue to change or reach a new landscape equilibrium with nutrient loading, remain unanswered. Given the ongoing changes observed the project to date the PI will continue the experiment for a total of 13 years to address: (1) long-term landscape evolution (autocatalytic or self-limiting?), (2) plant mechanisms (Is environmental filtering selecting for plants with lower belowground biomass that are less flood tolerant?); (3) microbial mechanisms (Does NO3- remove resource limitation on the microbes and disproportionately stimulate creek bank denitrifiers/decomposers?); and (4) the consequences for ecosystem function (With loss of creek edge marsh, do saltmarshes retain less N?). The investigators will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, genetic approaches, common garden experiments, and enriched 15N-NO3 - additions and delta 15N values in ecosystem components to understand mechanisms underlying ecosystem geomorphic and N cycle changes. This project incorporates new researchers to address questions of geomorphologic change, plant and microbial genetics, gene expression, whole-system ecosystem nutrient cycling, and denitrification.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This interdisciplinary project involving ecosystem, plant, microbial, biogeochemical, and geological researchers will test fundamental questions about controls on ecosystem structure and function and the long-term sustainability of nutrient enriched wetlands. Many detritus-based wetland ecosystems worldwide (boreal, tundra, salt- and fresh-water wetlands) are unexpectedly crossing tipping points suggesting there is a need to re-assess our theories and understanding on the nature and pace of their response to perturbation. Developing a predictive understanding of the controls on tipping points in natural ecosystems, and how these tipping points are altered by human activities, represents a major challenge in ecosystem science.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader social impacts of this project lie in addressing a globally important issue, coastal eutrophication. The educational impacts include enhancing high school to graduate student interdisciplinary training through a structured rotation among disciplines and hands-on field research. New partnerships with minority serving institutions and a RUI women's college will engage urban, underprivileged and minority students. A whole-ecosystem experiment is supported as a living lab for education and research infrastructure for the scientific community. The MBL's Science Journalism Program and the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge will be used to showcase the results to the public. Management outreach through workshops co-hosted with EPA and the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve will engage local, state and federal managers."

Sea-level reconstructions from the last 4000 years provide a context for understanding modern and projected rates of sea-level rise because Earth's climate system is relatively unchanged.  We will develop two new proxy RSL reconstructions from North Carolina to identify positive and negative departures from the perceived stability of sea level during the last 4000 years and support development of new predictive models in which the sea level-climate relationship can vary through time. The reconstructions will test the widely held assumption that sea-level rise from melting of large ice sheets was negligible during the last 2000 years and will help constrain rates of vertical land level movement. Data generated for the reconstructions will be used to further develop a model of salt-marsh response to sea-level rise that will provide a valuable service and tool to the coastal management community for informing policy decisions.  <br/><br/>While there are compilations of global and regional proxy temperature data for the late Holocene, little is known about sea-level variability during this period and the response of sea level to known climate deviations such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and 20th century warming is unknown. Using foraminifera preserved in North Carolina salt-marsh sediments, we will produce the first continuous, high resolution (decadal and decimeter) RSL reconstruction spanning the last ~4000 years. The sea-level reconstructions will calibrate new predictive models of sea-level rise to improve the accuracy and regional validity of projections. The new record will extend existing reconstructions to test the following hypotheses that are vital for understanding the climate sea-level relationship: (1) regional RSL was stable before AD 1000; and (2) the contribution from melting of large ice sheets sea-level rise ended 2000 years ago. Reconstructions derived from salt marsh sediment also provide a paleo perspective for predicting the ecological effects of future sea-level rise. The proxy sea-level record will validate, for the first time, the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM). The MEM describes the regulation of salt-marsh vegetation by changes in sea level. If sea-level rise is faster than the rate of salt-marsh sediment accretion, the productivity of salt-marsh vegetation will decline, resulting in the degradation or loss of these important coastal ecosystems. The proxy sea level record will test a central premise of the MEM that (3) Stable sediment organic matter (SOM) concentration varies inversely with the reconstructed rate of RSL-rise."

For several generations, empires have been the subject of scholarly investigations which privilege evidence, both material and historical, from the imperial capital.  Such approaches provide limited insight into those peoples living under the imperial yoke, often assuming a passive role on the part of provincial actors in the establishment of imperialism.  Tarsus-Gözlükule, as a provincial center, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of empire on a politically disenfranchised population.<br/><br/>Since the archaeological record preserves only a fraction of a society's material culture, the study of ceramics is one important means of investigating ancient lifeways.  Often the pottery from Tarsus-Gözlükule and other contemporary sites within the Hittite Empire as been interpreted as the product of a standardized ceramic industry linked to direct imperial control and divorced from any form of agency on the part of the provincial population.  A preliminary macroscopic analysis of the pottery from Tarsus-Gözlükule suggests more complicated patterns of production and consumption. Through petrographic analysis, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, and firing tests, it will be possible to offer further insight into the production and consumption of ceramics within a province of the Hittite Empire.  In this way, the dissertation will re-write the narrative for Cilicia in the later half of the second millennium, offer new insights into Hittite imperialism, and contribute to debates on empire within the discipline of Anthropology.<br/><br/>On a broader scale, this project will analyze material from an old excavation, contribute relevant data to ongoing research in the region, promote international collaboration, and convert dormant archaeological materials into pedagogical resources.  The ceramics in this study were excavated in the 1930s, when many of these technologies were either unavailable or in their infancy.  This re-analysis of previously excavated material and its subsequent dissemination in academic journals and conference papers is of fundamental importance to the discipline.  The mineralogical and geochemical data generated by this project will be an asset to current excavations at Tarsus-Gözlükule as well as several other sites in the region, and the exchange of this data will promote international collaboration between US and Turkish researchers.  Finally, the data and thin-sections produced for petrography will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses at Bryn Mawr College and will thus contribute to the training of a new generation of archaeologists."

In this method, electrochemically evolved hydrogen nanobubbles are used as reducing agents and templates to form metal hollow nanoparticles. This new synthesis concept possesses the potential to become a general route to varieties of nanostructures. In this project funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program, in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) will be employed to investigate the formation of nanobubbles and nanoparticles at different growth stages, and the synthesis of nanoparticles with more complicated structures and from different materials will be studied. First, the reaction mechanism and kinetics of metal reduction around hydrogen nanobubbles will be investigated by in situ monitoring the metal deposition using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The hypothesis of ""the reaction rate is higher for smaller bubbles"" will be tested through electron microscopy analysis of nanoparticles formed with different synthesis parameters. Then, the formation mechanism of electrochemically evolved hydrogen nanobubbles will be studied by in situ detecting the formation of nanobubbles on non-conductive areas on stripe pattern electrode surfaces using AFM. With Au nanoparticles as an indicator, the effects of the surface properties of supports and additives in electrolytes (such as surfactants and hydrogen evolution enhancers) on nanobubble formation will be studied using electron microscopy analysis. Finally, the synthesis of hollow nanoparticles of different electroless-depositable metals such as Pt, Pd and Ag and nanoparticles with more complicated structures such as multi-shells and half spheres will be explored. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>Nanotechnology is considered as one of the most potentially valuable technologies for U.S. in the global economic competition. As an important part of nanotechnology, metallic nanoparticles are widely used as catalysts in energy conversion and chemical industry, as imaging and therapeutic agents in biomedical applications, as building blocks in electronic and optoelectronic devices, and in many other areas. Through a systematic study on a new nanoparticle synthesis process - the bubble template synthesis, this research project funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program will lead to advances in the understanding of nanoparticle formation mechanisms, providing essential information for controlling the synthesis process to achieve the desired properties of nanoparticles. In addition, the new synthesis process can also be utilized as a convenient tool for studies on very small gas bubbles (nanobubbles) in liquid. This will have many important impacts on a wide range of bubble-related applications, from hydrogen generation and water electrolysis to the design of fluidic microchannels and nanodevices. This research program is integrated with a multi-layered education and outreach program, including course development for undergraduate nanotechnology education, interdisciplinary student training, summer camps for K-12 students, and outreach activities through annual ""Extending Your Horizon"" (EYH) conference for Philadelphia local middle school girls. Special emphasis has been placed on broadening the participation of both women and underrepresented Hispanic students in science and engineering by providing opportunities to women undergraduate students in Bryn Mawr College and Hispanic high school and college students in Texas with conducting state-of-the-art nanotechnology research in this project."

The two parental copies of imprinted genes must be distinguished from each other via an imprinting mark in order to properly control their expression. For some genes, the imprinting mark has been shown to consist of modifications to the DNA and/or to the proteins DNA wraps around in the cell; such modifications are called epigenetic because they affect DNA and chromatin structure but not DNA sequence. This research aims to investigate the acquisition of epigenetic modifications during mammalian development in order to better understand how chromosome structure influences the expression of imprinted genes. One way of addressing this question is by investigating the acquisition of DNA methylation at a specific imprinted gene at different stages of mouse embryonic development. The data obtained will then be compared to the pattern of DNA methylation acquisition at an adjacent gene in order to test the hypothesis that modifications to chromatin structure are coordinately controlled across neighboring regions of the genome. In addition, this research will examine the distribution of modified histone proteins at the imprinted Rasgrf1 gene. Rasgrf1 is expressed solely from the paternal copy in some tissues, but is expressed from both copies in other tissues. Because DNA methylation is associated only with the paternal copy of Rasgrf1, additional epigenetic factors must be responsible for regulating tissue-specific imprinting of this gene. Overall, this research will lend insight into the mechanisms governing the establishment and maintenance of chromatin structure critical for imprinted gene expression.<br/>Broader Impacts: This work will be conducted at Bryn Mawr College, an all-female undergraduate institution with an outstanding record of training young women scientists. Undergraduate students will be the primary researchers involved and will learn to conduct and critically evaluate scientific research under the direct supervision and mentorship of the PI during both the summer and the academic year. Students involved in this project will conduct cutting-edge research in the emerging fields of epigenetics and genomic imprinting, leading to an enhanced educational environment through the use of current methodologies to advance scientific exploration. Students conducting research in the lab will attend weekly lab meetings, present their research to the College community annually, and disseminate their data to the broader scientific community through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at both international scientific conferences and undergraduate research symposia. All of these research-related activities will prepare students for further education or careers in the biological sciences."

The research proposed here is to study magnetic bubble dynamics in nanodisks with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA).  The magnetic bubble state, a stable bi-domain configuration existing in nanodisks with PMA, consists of a circular domain wall that separates the nanodisk into two magnetic domains of opposite out-of-plane magnetizations.  The nontrivial topological structure in the magnetic bubble is expected to result in novel spin dynamics with potentially new technological applications. To probe the magnetic bubble dynamics, time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM) with a 90 ps time resolution and 100 nm spatial resolution will be used. The unique motion of a ground-state magnetic bubble and the switching between the ground and excited states of the bubbles will be investigated.  The non-linear spin dynamics in the excited bubble state and current-induced bubble dynamics will also be explored with the intent of developing a magnetic bubble-based spintronic device. This project will also provide undergraduate and graduate students an in-depth research experience and supportive mentoring. In addition, the PI will develop an interdisciplinary nanoscience course and an interactive website to educate the public about the achievements of young women scientists."

Lavas from the Arctic ridge segment known as the Eggvin Bank have chemical and isotopic compositions that reflect a more trace element-rich source than normal ridge basalts. The Eggvin Bank, which is anomalously shallow, is adjacent to the volcanic Jan Mayen Island, whose origins are disputed: its trace element enriched lavas may suggest a hotspot origin, but the precise isotopic and chemical compositions of the lavas are distinct from the Iceland hotspot. Jan Mayen may instead overlie a chemically distinct mantle, containing trapped subcontinental material from the geologically recent opening of the Greenland Basin (53-55 million years ago). These characteristics raise a number of questions: is the Jan Mayen magma source heterogeneous, containing different rock types that each had different origins? Is it hydrated? Does it indeed contain pieces of subcontinental mantle? Is Jan Mayen a rapidly upwelling hotspot? Does anomalous mantle affect the depth and composition of the nearby Eggvin Bank? These questions impact our understanding of the mantle, with implications for other regions along the mid-ocean ridge system that experience anomalous volcanism (e.g. the Azores, Ascension). A better understanding of the region will provide important information about how melting occurs and leads to volcanic activity and about the dynamics of the Earth?s mantle-crust system.<br/><br/>Using new multibeam backscatter bathymetry techniques, we will conduct the first high-resolution mapping of the Eggvin Bank, to characterize the nature of its volcanism and to precisely target new sampling. We will collect and compile fresh basaltic rocks from the Eggvin Bank, the adjacent Mohns Ridge to the north, and nearby Jan Mayen Island, selecting unaltered basaltic glass (an indication of very fresh lava material). We will measure uranium, thorium, and radium isotopes  as indicators of mantle source composition, of the amount of melting occurring to produce the lavas, and of the precise timing of melting and melt transport. Constraining the timing of melting in this way provides insight into the melting dynamics, including the presence of hotspot activity.<br/><br/>This work contributes to broad scientific efforts to better understand melt generation at ocean ridges and its implications for mantle dynamics.

Aphids are a type of insect that reproduce either sexually or asexually depending on the season (e.g., summer versus fall) and the process by which the progeny of sexual versus asexual aphids develop is very different. Sexual aphids lay eggs on leaves while asexual aphids give live birth and this results in dramatic differences in how the daughter eggs and embryos of these aphids develop (amount of yolk, number and size of cells, timing of events, etc.). This represents an extreme case of developmental plasticity, in which development has been altered due to changes in the environment with no change in the genome. The PI, his collaborators, and students have used molecular tools to detect differences in the expression of genes involved in key steps in the development of the progeny of sexual versus asexual aphids. The goal of this work is to continue to characterize the extent of these differences and these efforts should deepen our understanding of how early development can be dramatically altered without changing the genome. The work will take place at a predominantly undergraduate institution and thus an additional objective is to train undergraduate students in the design and execution of hypothesis-driven experimentation and data analysis within the discipline of developmental biology."

The fossils recovered include a complete cranium of a juvenile hominoid, and a nearly complete mandible of a colobine. Preliminary study of associated fauna suggests that the site is of late Miocene or early Pliocene age.  This is an interval of known global climatic change that witnessed the extinction and origination of many terrestrial mammals due to increased seasonality and heterogeneity of environments.  The new Yongle hominoid and colobine fossils thus appear to be, respectively, one of the geologically youngest of the Miocene apes and one of the geologically oldest of the Eurasian monkeys. The objectives of this project are to: (1) immediately complete the excavation of the primate-bearing locality due to duel threats of the impending monsoon season and potenetial vandalism, (2) conduct initial preparation, physical stabilization, and CT-scanning of the hominoid cranium and associated endocast, and (3) conduct preliminary paleomagnetic analysis on samples from the fossil-yielding section to help establish the geochronological framework of the site.  <br/><br/>This project has important implications for studies of primate and mammalian evolution.  It brings to light new species of fossil catarrhine primates that may represent early members of the gibbon and colobine lineages, and promotes a deeper understanding of the latest Miocene in East Asia, a poorly known period that played a crucial role in the evolution of modern faunal lineages due to the dramatic global and regional environmental changes during this time.  The broader impacts of this project include the collaboration with Chinese scientists and institutions to increase our knowledge of mammalian and primate evolution in the late Tertiary of Asia."

They appear as diplomatic gifts from distant rulers to European courts; in stories and legends and chronicles of distant lands and times; as manifestations of esoteric and sometimes forbidden knowledge; in courtly settings of great luxury; attached to monumental clockworks; as examples of technological innovation, and in the service of the Church. This research project examines the presence of automata in visual, textual, and material form in medieval Europe and, in the course of this examination, traces the interpenetration of scientific ideas, technological developments, philosophical theories, and cultural history. By examining different types of primary sources, including philosophical treatises, historical chronicles, scientific texts, archival documents, visual representations of automata, technical drawings, and literary sources, and using close analysis of textual, visual, and material sources, this study examines the developments in how automata were created from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, and how these shifts relate to developments in medieval natural philosophy and technology. Additionally, a particular theme of this project is how automata, and the knowledge needed to create them, were initially believed to be from the Arabic-speaking world, and were thus viewed with mistrust, suspicion, and fear, as well as desire and wonder. Over time, however, automata were decoupled from these origins, and took on new significance.  <br/>	<br/>This research will make significant intellectual contributions to several different fields. By revealing that automata were central to western medieval society, it will contribute to histories of science and technology as well as establish the importance of science and technology in medieval history. The project will also have a broader impact on scholars and scientists who work on robots, artificial life, and artificial intelligence. This project will place these scholars' interests and research on contemporary science into historical context, showing that current ideas about artificial, self-moving objects and the categories used to organize them have an intellectual, cultural, and scientific history that has been largely invisible. Lastly, this research will compellingly demonstrate that ideas often assumed to be novel developments of early modern natural philosophy are in fact rooted in medieval philosophy, scientific culture, and technological developments."

Wisconsin, Milwaukee, EAR-0920894<br/>Matthew Clapham, UC Santa Cruz, Ear-0918184 <br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The cause of the end-Permian mass extinction remains controversial.  However, some combination of CO2 or H2S toxicity and/or climate change, triggered or catalyzed by the eruption of the Siberian Traps, appears to be the most likely kill mechanism.  The biotic recovery from the end-Permian mass extinction has received less attention, despite the fact that the Early Triassic recovery was unusually long (~5m.y.)  The occurrence of ?anachronistic facies? (e.g., seafloor precipitated crystals, subtidal stromatolite bioherms, and wrinkle structures), multiple carbon isotopic excursions, and elevated seawater sulfate sulfur isotopic values in Lower Triassic strata suggest a prolonged period of anomalous environmental conditions following the mass extinction that may have delayed the biotic recovery.<br/>Multiple lines of evidence imply that the Early Triassic was a time of elevated atmospheric CO2 most likely resulting from the extreme volcanism of the Siberian Traps.  At the same time, metazoan reefs disappeared from the fossil record until the Middle Triassic, while calcifying marine invertebrates tended to be small.  These observations and experimental work on living organisms have raised concerns about the ecological consequences of ocean acidification, in reef ecosystems in particular.  Laboratory experiments with extant corals have demonstrated that as pH drops, corals survive as polyps without skeletons until pH returns to favorable levels.  It has been suggested that similar ocean acidification during the Early Triassic inhibited growth of large calcareous shells, favoring small organisms, and prevented corals from forming skeletons.  Thus, if the protracted recovery reflects a suppressed ecosystem due to elevated CO2 levels, Early Triassic communities may represent an ancient analog for the effects of greenhouse gas-forced ocean acidification on Earth?s ecosystems.  Considering the extreme importance of coral skeletal frameworks in supporting the biodiversity of modern reef ecosystems, the inability of corals to produce skeletons will most likely have severe and negative effects on fisheries and the economies that depend on them.  Thus, unusual Early Triassic deposits may provide a preview of marine ecosystems under conditions of increased atmospheric pCO2 and reduced ocean pH.<br/>The Lower Triassic of the western U.S. was deposited in two basins on the western coast of Pangaea, which together comprise a nearly complete record of the entire Early Triassic.  Studies of the biotic recovery in the western U.S. have largely focused on fossil abundance and diversity patterns and the occurrence of anachronistic facies.  These studies have demonstrated that anachronistic facies such as seafloor-precipitated aragonite fans and large subtidal stromatolite bioherms are found exclusively in deeper water settings, below fair-weather wave base (except for the immediate P-T boundary interval).  Crystal fans have been reported only from slope or basinal sections while stromatolite bioherms occur on flooding surfaces at the bases of parasequences in more proximal environments.  Both seafloor crystal fans and stromatolite bioherms are interpreted to have formed under anaerobic conditions.  The facies-dependent occurrence of anachronistic facies has led to the conclusion that anoxia was a deep-ocean phenomenon during the Early Triassic, and that shallower settings were a refuge from anoxia in the aftermath of the mass extinction.  The lack of evidence for shallow-water anoxia during the Early Triassic suggests that the biotic recovery in the shallow realm may have been hindered not by anoxia, but by hypercapnia and ocean-acidification due to high atmospheric carbon dioxide.<br/>The impact of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ocean acidification during the Early Triassic has received little study.  In order to understand the nature of the recovery, the independent and synergistic effects of deep-water anoxia and shallow-water acidification on marine ecosystems need to be examined in greater detail.  Because of the different environmental range of each stress, evidence for the two phenomena is rarely found in a single section; thus studies are currently hindered by the lack of a robust stratigraphic framework for the precise correlation of proximal to distal depositional settings both within and between the two Lower Triassic successions.  PIs will address this issue by creating a high-resolution bio- and chemostratigraphic framework for the western U.S. and then use those results to test two hypotheses related to the nature of the biotic recovery: 1) The oxygen isotopic composition of conodont phosphate and brachiopod carbonate indicates that the Early Triassic was a time of recurrent climate warming and ocean acidification resulting from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from Siberian Trap volcanism, and 2) spatially and temporally variable environmental conditions facilitated ecologic change in the Paleozoic Fauna that can be tracked in the immediate extinction aftermath and through the prolonged Early Triassic biotic crisis.<br/>"

They are adapted to the main challenge (the lack of space in the curriculum) by developing a series of modular experiments and demonstrations based on an elective laboratory that can be incorporated into a number of courses ranging from freshman to senior level, in both physics and engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and test various versions of teaching experiments and supporting materials to facilitate understanding of the concepts of superposition, interference, complementarity and non-locality in quantum mechanics by students with diverse backgrounds. A further goal is to acquaint the students with these concepts using the recently developed instrumentation of quantum information technology that can be used in other areas (e.g., in nanotechnology or biomedicine). A collaboration among a diverse group of schools (universities, community and liberal arts colleges, and a technical institute) is developing a combination of lecture courses on modern physics, quantum mechanics, and nanotechnology with experimental demonstration and hand-on experiments for undergraduates at all levels, including first year students. New compact equipment (e.g., a single photon source coupled with optical fibers) is being developed for sharing among institutions in a quantum optics teaching network. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The project addresses one of the most challenging concepts of modern physics in science and engineering education that is now being applied to important technological problems. Enormously powerful computers and total communication security are the future goals of quantum information technology.  It is important to familiarize the future workforce with these new ideas as well as to provide them with hands-on experience in photon-counting instrumentation widely used in many technological areas. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The project directly impacts a variety of science and engineering students with diverse backgrounds including under-represented groups. Dissemination of the results is by a constant development of a project website, building a national network with collaborative activities with similar course instructors from other universities, presentations and publications in educational journals, and by student publication and presentations at regional and national professional meetings. NSF Summer REU and RET programs and interactive workshops provide students and teachers from other institutions with an opportunity to learn about teaching experiments, and compact equipment may be borrowed from Rochester. A book on quantum optical teaching experiments is being prepared for publication."

This notion is particularly true with regard to how animals respond to variation in temperatures found within the environment, both at small spatial scales within an animal's home range or over large spatial scales across an animal's distributional range. Because many animals rely on environmental sources of heat to regulate their body temperature, when and where such heat sources are distributed in natural environments will determine whether an animal can persist in a particular area or how animals might disperse across different patches of habitat. Recently, computer modeling techniques have been developed to predict how animals should move through complex thermal landscapes based on physiological rates and thermal preferences. These models suggest that environments with more variable environmental temperatures, or with more isolated favorable habitat patches, should incur higher energetic costs for thermoregulating organisms because animals will have to move longer distances while searching for favorable habitat. This study will test such theoretical models with real data in living organisms. <br/><br/>Using Sphaerodactylus geckos (one of the smallest vertebrate organisms on Earth), behavioral data on temperature regulation and dispersal will be collected in a controlled laboratory setting where the complexity of environmental temperatures can be precisely manipulated. This experimental setup represents a model system whereby potential animal responses to changes in temperature can be evaluated. Results from this work will help researchers evaluate the influence of changing climates on animal populations in nature. Potential applications include predicting the suitability of altered habitats, predicting species ranges based on distributions of environmental temperature, or predicting potential impacts on migration routes due to changing environmental temperatures."

Approaching<br/>symplectic and contact geometry through a topological lens has<br/>given rise to a young and thriving discipline with interesting<br/>questions that explore the boundary between flexibility (when the<br/>symplectic world behaves topologically) and rigidity (when the<br/>symplectic world behaves geometrically).  In particular, the PIs<br/>plan to study the Arnold Conjecture for Legendrian submanifolds,<br/>squeezing phenomena for Lagrangian disks, and the cobordism<br/>theory of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Special attention will be<br/>paid to Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds and Lagrangian<br/>surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds. The methods used in<br/>addressing the aforementioned problems are of interest in their<br/>own right.

While<br/>remaining in touch with those roots, symplectic and contact<br/>topology have blossomed into a central mathematical field that<br/>combines features of geometry (the science of measurement) and<br/>topology (the study of the shape of space).  This field has a<br/>variety of applications including fluid mechanics, differential<br/>equations, and the study of the possible shape of the<br/>3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time in which we<br/>live. The goal of the PIs' project is to achieve a better<br/>understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between<br/>geometry and topology, and thereby strengthening the foundation<br/>for the aforementioned applications.

The two main areas that will be investigated are warped compactifications and generalized geometry. Three additional areas include global embeddings of local models of particle physics, the string theory LHC inverse problem, and a cosmological model in which conventional string theory vacua arise from a more symmetric phase in the past. <br/>Intellectual Merit: Nearly all compactifications of string theory currently under sudy are warped compactifications. It is proposed to apply string duality to derive the precise effect of warping in the reduction to 4D, and to check nonperturbative corrections to warped compactifications. The first project is essential for reliably computing perturbative mass spectra in string theory models. The second will increase confidence in recent nonperturbative mechanisms for moduli stabilization and for the generation of hierarchically small Majorana neutrino masses and mu-terms. Another critical ingredient in moduli stabilization and inflationary scenarios is internal magnetic flux, now generalized to nongeometric flux. The nongeometric flux radically alters our understanding of the internal geometry by destroying the usual 6D interpretation of the extra dimensions as a manifold. A set of strategies is outlined to more precisely characterize compactifications with generalized flux, and to extract the 4D physics of D-branes in this background. Of the remaining three proposed projects, two further advance the goal of connecting string theory to 4D physics at the scale soon to be probed at the LHC. The last project provides a concrete realization of a long speculated idea that conventional string theory vacua describe a symmetry breaking phase of a more symmetric underlying theory. <br/>Broader Impacts: The PI brings the exciting frontiers of string theory and elementary particle physics to Bryn Mawr College. Supervised research will foster diversity in science and engineering, by building on Bryn Mawr's strong tradition of individualized research mentoring of talented undergraduate women (a quarter of whom are students of color) and coeducational graduate students, with a proven track record of recruitment and retention. The Ph.D. program, as a feeder to the faculties of regional liberal arts colleges, expands research activity in high energy physics. The plan exploits existing infrastructure: departmental colloquia, the Tri-College PACT seminar, and connections to the University of Pennsylvania. The PI will initiate a Theory Lunch and a visitor program tailored to the needs of a high energy theory program at a thriving liberal arts college."

Group dynamics psychology posits that as threats from an out-group increases, in-group cohesion, with resulting increased support for in-group norms and values, and support for in-group leaders and increased sanction directed at deviates from in-group norms also increases.  When external threat declines or is perceived to decline, in-group cohesion declines and radical groups emerge.  Public opinions surveys can be used to gauge and track shifts in attitudes reflective of political radicalization.  Thus, the longer term goal of the proposed research is to develop a system of public opinion polling that tracks changes in the feelings, beliefs, and behavioral tendencies (i.e., sympathy and support for terrorism) by groups that in turn provides a data resource that can be used to further test existing theoretical developments regarding dynamics involved in group psychology. The immediate objectives of this proposal are to: develop and test the polling items required, initiate a fast-turnaround polling procedure using these items that focuses on Americans 18-30, and provide an initial U.S. benchmark survey for these items.   National surveys are proposed that will employ opinion items from previous surveys and new items developed for this research.  The first survey (2006), will focus on item development and an experimental assessment of the link between government threat and activist responses and will be implemented via Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS), with about 100 respondents and 17 items in each of eight conditions.  The second survey (2007) will test items and compare results of two fast-turnaround surveys focused on 18-30 year old respondents; one survey will use RDD (rapid digit dialing) sampling and the second will use a web survey panel.  The third survey (2008) will use improved items in a repetition of both RDD and panel surveys at the same time as these items are used in one wave of the American National Election Survey  (ANES) Panel.

One <br/>important aspect of such voluntary animal movements that has received relatively little <br/>attention is their episodic nature, with distinct beginnings and endings. Much is already <br/>known about the networks of nerve cells that control rhythmic movements like flying and <br/>swimming, but the nervous system components that control the initiation and <br/>termination of rhythmic behavior are largely unknown. The experiments funded by this <br/>grant are designed to significantly advance the understanding of how nervous systems <br/>process information generated by brief sensory stimuli and how they thereby produce <br/>episodic locomotion. <br/>Experiments will be conducted on isolated central nervous systems of the medicinal <br/>leech using two different approaches. One approach is electrophysiological, with <br/>experiments to investigate connections among nerve cells that control the initiation and <br/>maintenance of swimming movements. The second approach is pharmacological, with <br/>studies on the neurohormone serotonin and on other messenger molecules to learn <br/>how these substances are involved in converting the quiescent motor system into one <br/>that is functionally active. Because there is significant functional similarity between <br/>swimming and related locomotory movements in all animals and because the <br/>transformation of a system from quiescence to activity and back to quiescence is a <br/>feature of all episodic animal movements, insights gained from this research will have a <br/>major impact on our understanding of how the nervous system controls animal <br/>movements generally. <br/>The activities funded by this grant have a broader impact on science by increasing the <br/>opportunities for undergraduates, primarily women, to conduct scientific research at <br/>Bryn Mawr and at the University of Virginia. Also, experiments conducted in the <br/>research laboratory are subsequently incorporated into laboratory exercises for <br/>advanced neurobiology courses at both institutions. Finally, training is provided to <br/>graduate students in modern electrophysiological recording techniques, data <br/>acquisition, and analysis. Results from these experiments are widely disseminated <br/>through posters at scientific meetings, including student presentations at local science <br/>fairs and scientific meetings; publication in scientific journals; lectures open to the <br/>public; and demonstrations on animal behavior at K-12 schools."

To date, these descriptions represent the only record of the Spanish conquest and its impact on the lives of indigenous populations for this region. This project will examine a large sample of human skeletal remains and mummies from the Inca cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones in Peru (A.D. 1450-1570) to investigate the biocultural impact of Spanish conquest from the perspective of the actual individuals who experienced it by studying health, disease, and diet of these people. Pilot research conducted in 2004 resulted in the discovery of high frequencies of violent injuries, some of which were likely inflicted by Spanish weaponry, as well as a shift in burial practices, both of which may reflect warfare and the initial cultural upheaval accompanying Spanish conquest. It is hypothesized that if the community interred in the cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones suffered from epidemic diseases, then it is expected that individuals from all age categories, but especially more individuals in the prime of their lives, will constitute the sample. If the community did not experience epidemic diseases associated with Spanish conquest, then the age-at-death profiles will be comprised of individuals in the very young and very old age categories, characteristics that are typical of cemeteries with normal rates of attrition. <br/>The sample from Puruchuco-Huaquerones represents an ideal sample for the investigation of health, disease, and diet due to its large sample size (N=1,713 burials), representativeness (all age categories), its short time frame (< 120 years), and the exceptional preservation and completeness of the human remains. This research can contribute significantly across different academic disciplines, including but not limited to biological anthropology, archaeology, ethnohistory, historical demography, epidemiology, demography, and medicine. Its intellectual merit is apparent on several different levels.  If either hypothesis is supported by the results, then the presentation of new data from the Andean region will illuminate the ethnohistorical record about the biocultural impact of European contact.  In addition, it will provide new information on the population structure and longevity of individuals living prior to and after the arrival of the Spanish within a short time frame. New evidence from the mortuary contexts may detail the cultural disruption caused by the Spanish conquest and the degradation of traditional Inca mortuary behavior. The senior project personnel will train Peruvian and American students, which should advance more standardized research and alert future scholars to some of the challenges of research in biological anthropology, both in Peru, as well as in the field overall. The inclusion of undergraduate students from Bryn Mawr College (an all women's liberal arts college) will promote original undergraduate research and education in biological anthropology and contribute to a scientific foundation for the pursuit of careers in anthropology, biology, and medicine.

Clinker dominates the topographic form of many of the basins in which it is found, because it is more resistant to weathering than surrounding unaltered bedrock. It also preserves a record of the spatial-temporal patterns of fluvial incision, lateral backwasting, and plateau formation in these landscapes, because coal only burns when close to the surface, above the water table and ventilated with surface oxygen. Using (U-Th)/He ages of detrital zircons that are reset during clinker formation, we will map the patterns of coal burning and shallow exhumation in detail in several regions of the PRB in Wyoming and Montana, as well as characterize clinker ages over a broader scale throughout the basin.

Pollination by bees stands out as a key interaction on which most plants in natural systems and agriculture depend. In this collaborative project, researchers and students from two U.S. universities, a women's college, and Mexico will investigate the roles played by different native bees in the pollination of desert plants and how their roles change depending on the types of other plants and pollinators in the natural community.  Bees are an unusual pollinator group because many species are very selective in the plants they visit (these are known as ""specialized"" pollinators), while others are generalized, visiting a wide variety of plants.   Historically, it was assumed that specialized pollinators would pollinate only plants with elaborate flowers that were difficult for other pollinators to use.  Surprisingly, the investigators of this project have found that specialist bees most often go to plants with simple flowers that are also visited by many generalized pollinators.   In such cases, the contributions of specialists to their favored plant may be overwhelmed by those of the numerous generalists.   Using a set of focal plants, we address the questions:  Are these specialized bee species truly important to their host plants?  And, if so, does their importance change in concert with the blooming periods of different groups of flowering plants and generalist pollinators?  We will assess the importance of specialists and generalist pollinators by measuring the numbers of visits that each bee species makes to the plant and the number of pollen grains transferred during these visits.  These data will help reveal not simply how the identities of species change in response to others in the community, but how their functional roles change and what mechanisms underlie these shifts. The answers are central to understanding the structure of pollinator-plant interactions and how they vary in the face of changing environments."

However, despite their ubiquitous occurrence, few examples exist where deformation histories and processes responsible for orogenic curvature have been adequately quantified from geologic evidence.  These histories are embedded in regional structural trends, paleomagnetic directions, mesoscopic structures, and grain-scale fabrics of deformed rocks.  The Utah-Idaho-Wyoming salient of the Sevier orogenic belt is an ideal location to study processes that produce curvature over a range of scales.  Regional trends of major thrust faults and folds curve through 90 degrees from the north to south end of the salient, with additional local curvature near cross-strike transfer zones.  Rocks in the salient also carry multiple paleomagnetic components and display systematic suites of mesoscopic and microscopic structures (including cleavage, minor folds, minor fault networks, and deformed fossils), providing a record of rotations and internal strain within individual thrust sheets.  <br/><br/>Initial studies in the Wyoming salient reveal both primary pre-thrusting and secondary syn-folding paleomagnetic components that record complex rotation histories related to thrust curvature.  Initial studies also reveal broadly consistent regional strain patterns, with widespread layer-parallel shortening at high angles to thrust trends, minor tangential extension parallel to thrust trends, and minor wrench shear.  Calcite-twin strains, which accumulated during early layer-parallel shortening prior to large-scale thrusting, provide another reference frame that records locally significant rotations. Ongoing work is focused on combined paleomagnetic and structural studies of three 'swaths' located in the southern, central, and northern frontal parts of the salient, and on two stratigraphic levels (Jurassic Twin Creek Limestone and redbeds of the Triassic Ankareh Formation) that are well exposed, carry multiple magnetizations, and contain multiple strain markers.  <br/><br/>Analysis of slip lineation data from major thrust faults and construction of two-dimensional cross sections indicate that thrust transport directions change overall from ENE in the northern part to ESE in the southern part of the salient, and fault slip magnitude decreases toward the north and south ends of the salient.  Three-dimensional cross sections, constrained by abundant seismic data, and incorporating new strain and rotation data from this study, are being constructed to develop a robust kinematic model of the salient.  The model will be used to identify controlling mechanisms responsible for mountain belt curvature, including variations in stratigraphic thicknesses, strength changes along faults, motion of indentors, and foreland buttress effects.     <br/><br/>This investigation addresses several fundamental questions concerning the evolution of mountain belts. (1) What are the relations between rotations, strain, changes in thrust fault slip, and salient curvature? (2) What are the consequences of incorporating strain and rotation data into three-dimensional models of orogenic belts? (3) What factors are most important in developing curved mountain belts and how can these factors be best identified?  Ultimately, findings from the Wyoming salient will be compared with similar ongoing studies of other curved mountain belts, providing an array of viable models for the development of curved orogens.  Lastly, inclusion of strain and rotation data into three-dimensional restorable deformation models should improve our general understanding of hydrocarbon accumulations in fold-thrust belts.<br/>"

This problem is related to the Hopf <br/>conjecture, or more specifically to the question: how large is the family of <br/>nonnegatively curved metrics on the product of two spheres?  The PI will work <br/>with undergraduate students studying the metrics on such products obtained by <br/>re-scaling the product metric by a compact Lie group which acts by <br/>isometries.  Finally, the PI proposes to find obstructions to metrics of <br/>nonnegative curvature on vector bundles over spheres with prescribed soul <br/>metrics.<br/><br/>The question of which manifolds can have nonnegative curvature is central to <br/>Riemannian geometry.  Nonnegative curvature is a visually natural restriction <br/>on the way in which an object curves about in space.  All known examples come <br/>from compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics, which are indispensable <br/>tools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, and other <br/>disciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry.  The search <br/>for new examples of manifolds with nonnegative (or positive) curvature has a <br/>long history, yet very few constructions are known.  Since his tools <br/>represent a construction which is substantially different form known methods, <br/>the PI believes they deserve further study.<br/>"

The need to manage the growing amounts of diverse Earth science data has been recognized through a series of NSF-sponsored community meetings on Geoinformatics.  The GEON collaboration between IT researchers, who represent key technology areas relevant to GEON, and Earth science researchers, who represent a broad cross section of Earth science sub-disciplines, will provide the foundation for a national Geoinformatics program.<br/><br/>There is a pressing need in the Earth sciences for a national information infrastructure that enables the community to share databases and tools to enable interdisciplinary analysis of networked data sets in studying a wide range of phenomena including the interplay between tectonics and the evolution of sedimentary basins;  the role of mountain building in the evolution of climate and life;  broader predictive understanding and modeling capabilities of geologic hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanoes;  the 4D reconstruction of  the Earth through time;  and, managing the natural resources of our planet. Each of these problems requires interdisciplinary research to discover relationships among Earth science disciplines, and depends on the community's ability to construct an integrated geoscience information system.  The goal of GEON is to develop the necessary IT foundations and create such a system.<br/><br/>Many past and on-going projects in the geosciences have produced valuable sub-disciplinary and disciplinary databases.  Numerous national centers and organizations such as IRIS, UNAVCO, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), the Southern California Earthquake Center  (SCEC), as well as government agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), are contributing research and data to the community.  Building on this base, the imperative now is to take a step beyond research resulting in disciplinary databases, towards a new paradigm for interdisciplinary information integration and tool sharing via the creation of the GEON cyberinfrastructure.  The research products and services arising from GEON will be available to the entire scientific community and will transform the way in which geoscience research is conducted, opening unprecedented avenues for research and collaboration and providing the foundation for creating geoscience collaboratories.<br/>***<br/>"

Investigations of processes such as photoionization, photodissociation, and photo-association have required more detailed and accurate knowledge of the unique way molecular systems behave. In particular, understanding the role of electronic and nuclear spin in molecular systems has emerged as important in several areas, for example, high resolution photoionization studies, chemical reaction dynamics and loss mechanisms in cold molecule production in atomic traps. This has led to new theoretical efforts to incorporate electronic and nuclear spin dynamics into the highly successful theoretical approach of multichannel defect theory (MQDT). Fundamental questions are being raised, including: 1) How does spin angular momentum coupling vary with energy in molecular Rydberg states? 2) At what values of principal quantum number and electronic angular momentum do different behaviors emerge for different species? 3) Does nuclear spin affect either electronic or rotational autoionization of Rydberg states into different ionic states? 4) Do spin interactions play a role in the relative branching ratio between ionization and dissociation in the decay of highly excited states? 5) What role does internuclear separation play in these spin dynamics? <br/>This project proposes to begin addressing these questions by investigating the structure and dynamics of highly excited molecular states, including the effects of orbital and rotational angular momentum and vibration on molecular spin interactions, by using the novel approach of time-resolved, resonant four-wave mixing spectroscopy. The goal is to perform high energy resolution measurements within a given Rydberg series or a given vibrational progression in order to follow the evolution of angular momentum coupling as a function of energy and internuclear separation. By examining three fundamental systems with distinct molecular structures; H2, N2 and the OH radical, prototypical interactions and dynamics can be systematically investigated. This kind of data, taken together with MQDT analyses, promises to provide new insights into the unique nuclear and electronic angular momentum interactions that molecules exhibit.<br/><br/>"

Previous research demonstrates that integration of paleomagnetic studies with geochronologic, thennochronologic, barometric, and structural geologic observations can produce important insights into the tectonic evolution of the Insular superterrane and Coast Mountains orogen in western BC and SE Alaska.  The PI's recent results from near Prince Rupert show that paleomagnetism is a key component of multidisciplinary efforts investigating exhumed shallow and mid-crustal sections.  When accompanied by geologic observations resulting from a carefully coordinated multidisciplinary research program, paleomagnetic data on intrusive igneous rocks yield critical infon-nation on the tectonic development of defon-ned regions that cannot otherwise be obtained.  For example, the PI's have documented that panels of crust containing the Palcocene Quottoon igneous complex east of the Coast shear zone have experienced east-side-up tilts ranging to 40' during Eocene extension.  In addition, their geochronologic, paleomagnetic, barometric, and structural geologic data suggest that the midCretaceous Ecstall pluton was folded during west-directed thrusting.  These discoveries are fundamental to understanding the crustal architecture and tectonic development of the continental margin in the northern Cordillera.<br/><br/>Because igneous rocks were emplaced into this part of the magmatic arc during the Cretaceous, throughout the Paleogene, and into the Miocene, the Wrangell transect provides the opportunity to track deformation of an evolving convergent to strike-slip plate margin in space and time.  Methods will include U/Pb geochronology of zircon and sphene, Al-in-homblende barometry, 40 Ar/39 Ar thennochronology, (U-Th)/He dating of zircon, metamorphic petrology, and structural geologic investigations in addition to paleomagnetic analysis.  Preliminary investigations on the eastern portion of the transect indicate that this area experienced - 1 7' ESEside-up tilt about an axis with azimuth 22' since 20 Ma.  Observations from across the transect indicate that paleomagnetic directions from Cretaceous plutons are variable, with both concordant and discordant inclinations.  Paleomagnetic study of the Cretaceous and Tertiary igneous rocks of the Wrangell transect, coupled with the geochronologic, thermochronologic, and barometric analyses, can determine: (1) when and where Cenozoic deformation occurred; and (2) whether regionally consistent tilting/folding and/or large-scale transport can account for discordant paleomagnetic directions from Cretaceous plutons.  Combined with results from the Prince Rupert area, successful completion of the proposed research can provide a comprehensive model for the tectonic and paleogeographic evolution of the Coast Mountains and Insular superterrane for the past I 00 m.y.<br/>"

There are, however, aspects of behavior that have not been adequately explained by this approach. In the case of the medicinal leech, the neuronal network controlling the initiation of swimming is well-understood at several levels, but this understanding does not account for the unpredictability with which stimulation of this pathway leads to swimming. Two possible reasons for this inadequacy will be addressed in this proposal: (1) neuronal networks provide static descriptions of the system and do not accurately reflect their dynamics, and (2) even simple behaviors are a function of large populations of neurons distributed throughout the nervous system. <br/>Because of the inherent complexity in the firing patterns of large populations of neurons, computational approaches are necessary for deciphering how the nervous system encodes behavior. This project will use linear statistical and spectral techniques and nonlinear techniques, in conjunction with discrete wavelet transforms, to test: (1) whether the 'state' or pattern of ongoing activity in the leech nerve cord prior to stimulation determines the likelihood that swimming will be elicited by a specific input, and (2) whether the neuronal control of swim initiation is a distributed property of the entire ventral nerve cord or is localizable to neuronal activity from specific regions of the leech nervous system.

Whether the resulting ""creatures"" are real (as with mobile robots) or virtual (as with artificial life), it is becoming increasingly clear that apparently intelligent behavior emerges most naturally out of the interactions between a creature and a complex environment. Consequently, research in these areas of artificial intelligence draws on electrical and mechanical engineering, computer science, and psychology, as well as biology and philosophy. Both mobile robotics and artificial life have proven to be highly effective at engaging students in hands-on, collaborative learning about a topic that is inherently interdisciplinary. The use of mobile robots in classrooms includes the Autonomous LEGO Robotics Course at Case Western Reserve University (See eecs.cwru.edu/courses/lego375), an Artificial Intelligence Course at Bryn Mawr (see mainline.brynmawr.edu/courses/cs372/fall98), a Robotics Course at Swarthmore College (See palantir.swarthmore.edu/~Maxwell/classes/e28), and many others. Similarly, artificial life and genetic algorithms have been successful in undergraduate courses recently. Examples are Emergence, Evolution, and Life at Reed College (see reed.edu/~mab/courses/mals555), Artificial Life Course at Cal Tech (see krl.caltech.edu/~charles/cns175), and Topics in Genetic Algorithms Course at the University of New Mexico (see cs.unm.edu/~forrest/ga-class/syllabus.html). These topics have also been used successfully in classes across the Scientific and Philosophical Studies of Mind (SPM) curriculum at Franklin & Marshall College (F&M). This project is expanding the current artificial intelligence offerings by implementing, over a three-year period, an artificial intelligence laboratory as a crucial component of the SPM curriculum. The new lab is equipped with 5 iMac computers for running various artificial life and mobile robotics experiments; HandyBoard robot controllers, sensors, and Lego pieces for building 5 additional mobile robots; and software (StarLOGO, CodeWarrior, Brainwave, and InteractiveC) to compile and upload programs to the robot controllers as well as to run artificial life simulations. During the first year of the grant, the PIs are building the necessary sensors and interface boards to create 5 new robot kits as well as to upgrade 5 existing robot kits, and adapt artificial life resources developed elsewhere to the kind of non-UNIX computing environment available at F&M. During the second year, they will integrate mobile robotics with artificial life (in particular genetic algorithms) so as to enable the robots to learn how to respond appropriately to their environments. During the third year, they will refine these implementation of robot learning so as to devise demonstrations and experiments for upper-level artificial intelligence courses in the SPM curriculum. Moreover, during the second and third years, the PIs will reassess the lab in light of student feedback and retool it where necessary. The result is that activities in the lab will allow students to develop conceptual understanding of self-organization, emergence, evolution, embodiment and the neural basis of intelligence, and practical abilities in engineering, robotics and computer programming. Indeed, given the limited resources of a liberal arts college like F&M, creating opportunities for this kind of hands-on, engineering experience is not possible without being linked in this way to fundamental components of a liberal arts education like philosophy, psychology and biology. Moreover, the lab will foster increased interdisciplinary connections among the Psychology, Philosophy, Computer Science, and Physics Departments, both affecting faculty development and increasing substantially the inter-disciplinary content of relevant courses."

Genetic malfunctions of molybdenum enzymes in humans are the cause of the fatal combined oxidase deficiency disease.   The work is expected to provide spectroscopic and structural benchmarks to aid in the interpretation of analogous data on the enzymes, and to provide insights into their active site chemistry.

It  addresses the national need to provide consistently effective models for science and mathematics teaching at a time when students come with increasingly varying pre-college preparation. The program builds upon a wide array of efforts previously undertaken at Bryn Mawr, with the support of various private and federal funding sources, and is informed by national efforts in undergraduate science education reform.    Building Bridges seeks: to improve the teaching of math and science through efforts that bring together scientists, humanists and social scientists; to infuse the inquiry-based and cooperative pedagogical methods of the teacher education program into math/science teaching; and to encourage greater interaction among college faculty members, precollege teachers, and students. Specific activities will include: workshops for faculty members teaching in a new cross-disciplinary College Seminar program, required of all undergraduates; a discussion series on science pedagogy for faculty members, graduate students, and precollege teachers; support for the development of courses incorporating new pedagogical approaches, the revision of introductory science courses, and the development of courses bridging math/science and teacher education; and a peer tutoring program for math and science students. The results of Building Bridges will be evaluated both quantitatively, in terms of the extent of faculty participation in the project, and qualitatively, through an existing student course evaluation program and an assessment of the impact on faculty/student attitudes toward and sense of competence in science. The work undertaken through Building Bridges will be institutionalized at the end of the three-year grant period, and its results disseminated through Serendip, a College Web site, and through presentations at national science and science education  meetings."

This program, entitled ""Enhancing  Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE),"" is designed to  strengthen the ability of the targeted student population to  successfully negotiate the transition from undergraduate to  graduate education in mathematics, and to succeed in those  graduate programs.  The program focuses primarily on recent  graduates of undergraduate mathematics programs who will attend  graduate programs in the mathematical sciences the following  fall.    For the past four years, the Principal Investigators have co-directed the NSF-sponsored Spelman-Bryn Mawr Summer Mathematics  Program, aimed at identifying and encouraging talented young  women to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.  Now, as a  continuation of this effort, the two institutions are addressing  a persistent problem that continues to thwart the efforts of  earlier intervention programs, namely the attrition of talented  women and minority students from graduate programs in  mathematics.  Attrition for these groups is disproportionately  high, and students who are not successful in one program are  often lost from the pipeline altogether.    In order to realize its goals, the program helps students develop  a stronger background in the basic areas of analysis and algebra.   In addition, the program establishes mechanisms to provide  prospective female graduate students with (1) a clear  understanding of what will be expected of them in graduate  school, (2) the basic tools needed to increase both their  confidence and their ability to compete in graduate school, (3) a  support network aimed at keeping them in the mathematical  sciences once they have begun their graduate work, (4) a broad  perspective about mathematics and its connections to other  disciplines, and (5) an understanding of their own  strengths and  weaknesses under stress, in group study, and in a competitive  environment.    The structure of the program involves two basic components: (1)  an intensive summer program, and (2) a follow-up mentoring  program.  The summer program includes two six-week core courses;  four one-week minicourses on exciting areas of mathematical  research; and problem sessions aimed at preparing participants  for graduate qualifying exams.  The mentoring program involves  graduate institutions in the identification of appropriate  mentors who will serve as advocates for the participants from the  beginning of their graduate study.  A continuing support network  is provided by the Principal Investigators, student participants,  and graduate student mentors.  In addition, the project includes  a comprehensive study, done in conjunction with a sociologist  experienced in investigating issues involving gender and science  in higher education and at the professional level, whose aim is  to determine the effectiveness of the program in helping students  to negotiate the various stages of their graduate education.    Over a period of four years, between forty and fifty women, at  least half of whom are from underrepresented minority groups,  will be directly supported in their efforts to persist to the  Ph.D. degree in the mathematical sciences.  As a result, it is  expected that the success rate of women and minorities in  graduate programs in the mathematical sciences will increase,  beginning with the rates at participating institutions.  The  evaluation process will also provide the mathematics community  with intensive data about the experiences of minorities and women  in graduate programs in the mathematical sciences."

The Principal Investigator will spend a full sabbatical year of research at the Scripps Research Institute in the laboratory of Dr. James R. Williamson.  The host laboratory was chosen because Drs. Williamson and White have shared interests in RNA structure and RNA recognition by proteins, and because they are both working on the yeast L32 system.  Briefly, yeast ribosomal protein L32 binds to its unspliced or spliced transcript to inhibit splicing or translation and thus is an autoregulatory protein.  During the past six years, Dr. White's laboratory has discovered that model L32 RNAs as small as 24 nucleotides bind L32 at nanomolar affinities, making this system an attractive target for structural studies.  The Williamson laboratory is currently engaged in NMR studies of L32 RNA and its binding protein.  The proposed research will provide more biochemical data that will complement the structural data.  The two questions specifically addressed are hydrogen bonding status of potential non Watson-Crick pairs and localization of amino acid residues critical for RNA binding.  The first set of experiments will address the question of hydrogen bonding in the L32 RNA's internal loop.  The L32 RNA adopts a stem-internal loop-stem structure and the internal loop is critical for protein binding and is composed of purines.  The previous structure-mapping experiments show that some bases in this region are stacked, but that particular purine N7 positions are accessible to chemical modification.  A pair of juxtaposed GA dinucleotides is conserved as is a potential G:U pair bordering the internal loop.  The RNA will be chemically modified at the base positions that normally participate in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding.  Comparisons of denatured and folded L32 RNA will indicate whether the folded RNA is protected from chemical modification by virtue of hydrogen bonding.  This detection of chemical modification by primer extension will be an import ant and versatile new technique for the White laboratory.  Secondly, a powerful new genetic screen will be used to determine which L32 amino acids contact particular RNA nucleotides.  A two-plasmid system will be used to find suppressor proteins that restore binding to mutant RNAs.  The reporter plasmid will encode the sequence for the L32 binding site just upstream of a beta-galactosidase gene.  RNA sequences deficient in protein binding will be chosen.  The gene for the randomly mutagenized L32 protein will be expressed on the other plasmid, the repressor.  If the protein variant fails to bind to the L32/beta-galactosidase transcript, then beta-galactosidase will be produced.  However, if the protein does bind the chimeric transcript, the binding will block access to the ribosome binding site and little if any of the protein will be produced.  Suppressors will be identified by a blue/white colony color test and by measuring repression ratios.  Ultimately a map which links a particular RNA nucleotide with a particular amino acid will result.  At the same time, the Williamson group will be working to solve the structure of the L32 protein and its RNA complex by NMR.  This two-pronged approach of a genetic screen and structure determination should prove to be a powerful one.  Setting up of the screen will bring new techniques to Dr. White's group when she returns to Bryn Mawr.  The opportunity to undertake a full year as a Visiting Researcher at the Scripps Research Institute which is provided by this POWRE award will enable Dr. White to make progress on the biochemistry of the L32c system, learn new techniques, collaborate with structural biologists, and interact with the very stimulating scientific community at Scripps.   ***"

The evolution of ammonoid suture complexity through time, as a single-character measure of biological complexity, and with respect to evolution of suture complexity in different ammonoid clades; and   3. The effects of extinction events on ammonoid morphospace, and on morphologic and taxonomic diversity, focusing on three major crises: the U. Devonian Frasnian/Famennian, the Devonian/Carboniferous, and the Permian/Triassic.    The scope is unprecedented in ammonoid investigations, in terms of (a) its time span (~190 my); (b) the comprehensive treatment of all 627 Paleozoic ammonoid genera (212 Devonian, 263 Carboniferous, 152 Permian) plus an additional subset of 25-30 genera (75-100 species) of basal Triassic ammonoids.  Additionally, in order to precisely evaluate the timing of major extinction's and to assess susceptibility, persistence, and recurrence of shell morphotypes to these events, we will undertake PC analysis of variation in a combined total of 700-750 species (~150 genera) present during the ca. 0.5-5 my intervals spanning each of the three extinction episodes.      This research will be the most complete morphometric treatment of Paleozoic and early Mesozoic cephalopods ever undertaken.  It will generate a 21+ character morphometric data-set for more than 600 ammonoid genera and an additional 700+ species that is taxonomically up-to-date, complete and stratigraphically precise.  The time-stepped analysis by PCA will permit documentation of how clades evolved, changed in morphologic diversity and richness, and how they responded to biotic crises.  The results will have bearing on the interpretation of macro-evolutionary change, the evo lution of complexity, the influence of morphologic constraints and extinction events on variation and diversity, all on a time scale of nearly 200 million years."

Reinhard Bernbeck and Susan Pollock will conduct three seasons of archaeological fieldwork at the site of Kazane located in Southeastern Turkey. Occupied over a 4,000 year span, the earliest levels of the site date to the Halaf period, ca. 6th millennium B.C. and these lowest horizons will provide the focus for Dr. Bernbeck's and Pollock's research. Their goal is to delineate household groupings to determine the extent to which status differences among them are evident and to accomplish this they will conduct three seasons of field excavation. They will expose a relatively large horizontal area of Halaf occupation and map distributions of artifacts, features and architecture. This will provide evidence on the distribution of economic activities and thereby identify households. To examine changes over time in the distribution of activities they will open deeper stratigraphic soundings. Systematic recovery of artifacts, faunal and floral remains will be ensured through a rigorous program of screening sediments and floating them to obtain light seeds and other organic remains. The measurement of volumes of all excavated deposits will permit calculation of densities  and this will allow comparison of activities in different contexts. Preliminary work by the investigators in 1996 has indicated that significant variation across units does exist.  The Halaf period is important because it was during this time that the first indications of Near Eastern civilization become apparent. The period is best known for its elaborately painted and technically sophisticated pottery which suggest craft specialization. However interpretations of level of social organization vary widely. Traditional interpretations characterize the Halaf period as a fully sedentary, village based society which relied on the cultivation of crops and the raising of animals. The presence of some large sites has been interpreted as an indication of an emerging social and political hierarchy. However other evidence has pointed in the opposite direction suggesting that many sites were occupied for brief periods of time and that an egalitarian form of organization prevailed. By examining synchronic variation between  households it is possible to address this question directly.  This research is important because it will provide important information on the development of civilization in the Near East. It will yield data of interest to many archaeologists."

Their history and phylogeny have been thought to be well understood, and their systematics have remained relatively unchanged for ~50 years, during which three tenets have remained unchallenged:  1)  nautilaceans were evolutionarily conservative, showing little morphological change since the end of the Triassic; 2)  most genera can be differentiated by only one or two characters; and 3)  the last-evolved member is extant Nautilus, having evolved in the Pleistocene or Pliocene.  In the last decade, however, new information suggests that a radical re-evaluation of both the phylogenetic interpretation and the classification of the group are in order.  It now appears that post-Jurassic nautilacean species have been vastly over-slit; new fossil finds show that the genus Nautilus dates back at least to the middle Cretaceous; recent investigations demonstrate several new characters that will aid in the cladistic evaluation of the group; and preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the Nautilaceae stands in marked contrast to past interpretations.   We propose to develop a suite of morphologic characters that will permit us to undertake cladistic analysis of the group, in order to develop understanding of evolutionary relationships, and to assess the validity of named fossil taxa in the light of our understanding of variation and species-and generic concepts in extant taxa.  We will use the presence of shared derived characters to develop a classification system of the group, based on evolutionary relationships, rather than morphological similarity.   In addition, we propose to use principal components analysis (PCA) in order to:  a)  quantify and to track morphologic variation and diversity through time; b)  determine whether (which) particular shell morphotypes were preferred and the relationship between theoretical and occupied morphospace  over an extremely long time span (>200 my); and c)  assess how these morphologies responded to biotic crisis, focusing on the terminal Triassic- and Cretaceous extinction events.   The results of our investigation will bear directly on understanding the evolutionary history of this particular lineage, one of the longest ranging of molluscan clades, extending from the Recent to the Triassic (~230 million years).  The results will have bearing on the interpretation of macroevolutionary change in morphologic diversity and richness, and to morphologic responses to biotic crisis, on a scale of nearly 200 million years."

The rate at which sediment is generated in such drainage basins and the residence time of that sediment as it moves, grain by grain, down the fluvial transport system are poorly  known; yet measuring these rate is prerequisits to understanding dynamic  interactions between the solid Earth and the hydrosphere.    Over the past decade, advances in mass spectrometry have allowed reliable measurement of extremely rare nuclides such as those produced as cosmic rays interact with rock. Because cosmogenic nuclide abundances (when normalized for exposure location) reflect the residence time of material within the uppermost several meters of Earth's surface, simple analytical models (beholden to a variety of assumptions) have been used to estimate ""cosmogenic"" exposure ages and erosion rates of bedrock outcrops and boulders.    During the past two years, we have been funded by Hydrologic Sciences to test an interpretive model (Bierman and Steig, 1992, 1995; Brown et al., 1995; Granger et 1994a,b) which suggests that measurement of cosnogenic 10Be and 26A1 in sediments can be used to estimate the rate at which drainage basins erode and constrain the transport system, and out of the basin. Because our initial data (Bierman et apt, 1995, in review) and the data of others (Brown et al., 1995; Granger et al., l994a,b), suggest that cosmogenic nuclides are indeed useful tools by which to study hydrologic processes in small end moderate size drainage basins, we seek funding to expand our current research to larger scales and over longer tine frames.    The overall objective of our proposed research is to determine at what scale and in what fluvial regimes, cosmogenic nuclides remain useful tools for 1) determining basin-scale, spatially-averaged erosion rates and 2) placing limits on  the duration of sediment storage. In order to meet this objective, we seek funding for isotopic and other corollary measurements needed to determine the spatial variation in 10Be and 26A1 abundances in approximately 80 samples collected from locations throughout the drainage networks of four tectonically and climatically distinct fluvial systems.: the Ganges (Himalayas), the Apure (Andean Mountains), the Sagavanirktok (Alaska, North Slope) and the East Alligator (northern Australia).    Testing the spatial and temporal variation of 10He and 26A1 abundance in sediments of some of the World's major rivers will constrain the scale of applicability of existing interpretive models, a significant advance in Isotope Geochemistry. The data we generate regarding the relative duration of sediment storage and model rates of basin scale denudation will be of fundamental significance in the fields of Sedinentology, Hydrology, end Geomorphology. In the sense that we cannot anticipate the outcome of our measurements, some might consider our proposal ""high risk science In light of the success we and others have had using 10Be and 26A1 to estimate erosion rates and constrain sediment storage times in smaller catchments (Biermam et al., 1995, in review; Brown at al., 1995; Granger et el., 1994a,b), and because of the fundamental nature of the questions we are addressing, we feel such a ""risk"" is minimal and worth taking."

Previous experiments have localized the site of protein contact to the loop and some preliminary work to explore the sequence requirements for protein binding has been completed.  The experiments proposed herein directly address the question of hydrogen bonding within the internal loop.  Chemical modification of the hydrogen bonding faces of those bases not involved in pairing will be detected by primer extension methods.

At the outset, the purification protocol will be improved and the purified protein will be subjected to analysis of the protein, the CD spectrum of the complex will be compared to that of the RNA to determine whether protein binding changes the helicity of the RNA.  To determine which protein residues contact the RNA, crosslinking experiments will be carried out using native and modified RNA.

These experiments will require some work to develop practical, general techniques which work for all RNA protein complexes.  In the third and final portion of the proposal, the mechanism of repression is examined.  Evidence from  one laboratory suggests that the U1 snRNP binds to the L32RNA/RPL32 complex  to form a termolecular complex incapable of splicing. The initial hypothesis is that the U1 RNA strengthens the binding of  L32 RNA to RPL32 and that the dissociation of RPL32 is slowed or prevented by complexation with the two RNAs. The Education Plan is based on the first three years of teaching at Bryn Mawr College. The overriding curricular philosophy is to devise genuine chemistry courses which convey the current excitement in biochemistry.  Every attempt is made to challenge  the students to become active, critical learners who see themselves as participants in the scientific enterprise.  Given Bryn Mawr's mission to  educate young women, it is particularly important to encourage its students to realize their scientific ambitions.  For undergraduates, a full year of  research is often the culmination of their liberal arts education and is frequently their first truly independent research experience.  It is a challenge to design projects where students can do successful experiments while contributing to the progress of the laboratory. Problem solving, visualizing molecules, moles, equilibria, and kinetics are still vital parts of  General Chemistry which students must master.  The challenge of teaching at the introductory level is thus to simultaneously hold the students' interest and insist that they develop the skills needed for future work in science.  %%%  This research involves the study of the structure of an RNA involved in regulating the production of a protein.  Unlike DNA, which forms a symmetric, elongated double helix, RNA forms a complex, convoluted shape.  While all of DNA's bases are involved in either G-C or A-T pairs, in RNA some bases are paired but others are not.  The first portion of the research involves determining which bases pair.  Due to its complicated structure, RNA presents a variety of features which could be recognized by a protein.  In the system under study, a small protein binds to a portion of an RNA which has both non-standard base pairs and unpaired bas es.  Experiments will be done to define how the RNA and protein features contribute to this molecular recognition event.  When the protein is bound to the RNA, its biological function is blocked.  Model experiments will be designed to test mechanisms for this repression of protein production. The teaching of biological chemistry to advanced students and introductory chemistry is discussed in the education plan.  The common theme is to challenge the students to learn a rigorous experimental science while sharing in the excitement of current developments in biochemistry.  ***"

This means that an animal decides,  often very rapidly, which behavior is appropriate for the  circumstances at that moment.  The concept of `motivation'  is often used to explain this type of short-term behavioral  variability observed under conditions where sensory input is  constant.  The underlying neuronal mechanism of motivation,  however, has yet to be defined.  Since an animal's survival  depends upon it continually making the appropriate  behavioral response to ever changing environmental  conditions, understanding how an animal decides upon an  appropriate motor response is integral to our understanding  of animal behavior.    In the medicinal leech, research on the neuronal basis of  swimming has progressed to the point where the initiation of  swimming following body wall stimulation can be traced from  the sensory neurons that perceive the stimulus to the motor  neurons that produce the swimming movements.  However,  stimulation of this pathway does not always elicit swimming.  The probability that swimming occurs following a given  stimulus trial is quite variable.  The role that a pair of  identified interneurons in the leech head ganglion plays in  biasing the behavioral response of a leech toward swimming  following a given sensory input will be addressed in this  proposal.  The results generated from this study will  provide additional insights into the principles governing  behavioral variability in the leech with respect to the  initiation of swimming, and further enhance our  understanding of the types of neuronal networks and  mechanisms that can influence the motivational state of  animals."

Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 3-manifolds is similar.  Mathematicians interesting               themselves in problems of quantum field theory were led to a                    certain geometric construction.  The construction led in turn to an             invariant that depended only on the topological character and not               the full geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are             now variations on the original construction and numerous resulting              quantum invariants.

The program would build on and be                modeled after a ""pre-REU"" program that has taken place at Bryn                  Mawr for the past three summers and would complement the Scholars               in Mathematics Program at Spelman.  Eight students would conduct                research whose primary focus is experimentation and exploration                 using the computer; they would be aided by alumnae mentors who                  are just beginning graduate programs in the mathematical                        sciences.  Other features of the program include weekly                         roundtable discussions on issues in mathematics research and                    teaching, employment as teaching assistants in the students'                    respective departments during the academic year, travel to a                    national AMS-MAA meeting, encouragement to participate in an REU                or summer internship program the following summer, and mentoring                and advice regarding the decision to attend graduate school as                  well as the choice of an appropriate graduate program.                               The Summer Program will be held for the next two years on                  the campus of Bryn Mawr College.  The program builds on and                     complements existing undergraduate programs at both Bryn Mawr and               Spelman Colleges and enhances an exchange program between the                   colleges that began in 1984.  It is anticipated that this program               would serve as a model for other early intervention and exchange                programs at the undergraduate level."

His research will focus on the                  Swahili speaking region of the Kenya coast and he will attempt                  both to reconstruct the Iron Age prehistory of the region and to                set this into an ethnographic context.  In particular, he will                  examine the role of iron technology in culture development and                  change.  Although traditional iron working is no longer practiced               in this area, elderly men still have knowledge of the techniques.               Therefore, in the ethnographic phase of this project, Mr. Kusimba               will conduct extensive interviews.  He will also observe iron                   smelts conducted for his benefit and collect samples of raw                     materials, slag and finished products.  These, as well as similar               remains collected by archaeological excavation, will undergo                    laboratory analysis.  In a second phase of the project, he will                 conduct a regional archaeological survey and excavate at the site               of Mtwapa which is located near Mombasa.  The site consists of                  approximately twenty acres of mud brick ruins and dates to the                  Iron Age.  Data from Mtwapa will serve not only to examine                      prehistoric iron working techniques, but also to show how this                  major site developed and then declined over time.                                                                                                               The Swahili peoples are distributed along the East African coast                and they were transformed in less than a millennia from small                   scale fishing and agricultural groups into an urban, literate,                  Islamic and maritime trade oriented civilization.  While a                      central aim of archaeological research is to understand the                     development of social complexity, relatively little attention has               been devoted to this case.  Mr. Kusimba wishes to determine the                 role which technology played in this transformation.  Because                   iron was crucial to sub-Saharan peoples and because it was                      locally produced, it provides an excellent focus for Mr.                        Kusimba's study.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  On an empirical                level it will collect data on traditional metalworking techniques               which (given the age of remaining practitioners) would otherwise                soon be lost.  It will increase scientific knowledge of East                    African prehistory and assist in the training of an extremely                   promising young scientist"

Properties of non-cocompact subgroup actions                 in Z^2-actions are to be examined, in particular when the action                has a rigid property like minimal self-joinings or simplicity.                  She will also study further the centralizers of rank 1 actions of               Z^2. She will continue her work on cellular automata, in                        particular on the continuity of directional entropy. She will                   seek representations of certain kinds of geodesic flows, from                   geometry, as flows built under ceiling functions.                                    Classically, ergodic theory is concerned with what happens                 in the long run when a transformation of a space is iterated many               times. (The space in question need not be anything particularly                 elaborate; something like a line segment will do.) Via the                      transformation, one can think of the group Z of integers acting                 on the space, or of time passing in discrete steps. Continuous                  time, similarly, is modeled by an action of the group R of real                 numbers, called a flow. This situation is also of interest in                   ergodic theory. A good example is a geodesic flow on a surface,                 where points on the surface are imagined as moving at constant                  speed along paths of shortest distance. A principal goal of                     research in ergodic theory is to classify the various sorts of                  long-run behavior that are possible in a given situation.                       Typically, there will be not too many, and all of them will be                  realizable within an appropriate standard model, or                             representation. Professor Park's research is concerned with what                happens for other groups beside Z and R. The general framework of               ergodic theory still makes sense, but new phenomena appear, even                in the case of the group Z^2 of pairs of integers."

The plutonic rocks will be studied to determine their             post-emplacement history interms of pressure (depth) and temperature as         a function of time.  This latter information will help constrain the            deformation and uplift history of the entire coast plutonic complex."

Implementation of these goals is accomplished in three           steps: (a) introduction of the basic concepts of NMR spectrometry               through experimentation followed by qualitative application to organic          structure determination; (b) remodeling of the advanced laboratory              sequence to include a series of comparative experimental projects using         NMR and other complimentary techniques, and (c) development of                  applications to undergraduate research projects."
