2416630,RUI: Effects of Adverse and Buffering Childhood Experiences on Neural Markers of Emotion Regulation in Young Adulthood,BCS,"DS -Developmental Sciences, Cognitive Neuroscience",1/1/2025,7/24/2024,Rebecca Compton,PA,Haverford College,Standard Grant,Elizabeth F.

The experience of adversity in childhood is relatively common in the general population, but the many pathways through which adversities affect development are not fully understood. The objective of this project is to better understand one aspect of how adversity may affect brain and cognition by examining the relationship between early life stress and the ability to regulate emotional responses to both unpleasant and pleasant information. The project tests whether a specific neural marker of emotional reactivity is poorly regulated in young adults with a history of greater early-life stress, compared to those with lower levels of life stress.  This research occurs at a primarily undergraduate institution and provides mentored research experiences for about a dozen undergraduate students with a focus on electrophysiological data collection and analysis methods, as well as interactions with the wider scientific community, strengthening their STEM training.<br/><br/>The project includes three studies that test the correlation between reports of early-life experiences and an EEG (electroencephalography) brainwave signal referred to as the late positive potential (LPP). The LPP signal, generated from broad regions of posterior cortex and measurable with scalp electrode recordings, is known to be elevated when people view pictures with emotional meaning. Furthermore, the LPP can be downregulated by voluntary cognitive reframing, such as thinking about the image in a less threatening way. Study 1 tests whether the ability to decrease the LPP response to unpleasant pictures by cognitive reframing is compromised in young adults with a history of adversity. Study 2 tests whether the ability to voluntarily increase the LPP response to pleasant pictures, a process known as ?savoring,? is also compromised in those with early-life stress. Study 3 investigates whether people with different levels of adverse experiences are able to make adaptive choices about which strategies to use to modify their brain?s LPP response to emotional pictures. The project also investigates the possible role of executive functioning skills in the path linking adversity and the ability to regulate emotion. Together, the studies aim to better understand one mechanism that may connect early-life stress with altered psychological outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2416182,Collaborative Research: Subregular Inference of Morpho-phonology,BCS,Linguistics,9/1/2024,8/15/2024,Jane Chandlee,PA,Haverford College,Standard Grant,Wilson De Lima Silva,8/31/2027,"$104,114.00 ",,jchandlee@haverford.edu,370 W LANCASTER AVE,HAVERFORD,PA,190411336,6108961000,SBE,131100,"1311, 9251, SMET",$0.00 ,"The ability to learn language is a fundamental part of being human, but researchers do not yet understand the mechanisms that underlie this ability. This research focuses on two aspects of this mystery: how humans learn the words of their language (morphology), and how they acquire the systematic variation in the pronunciation of these words (phonology). For example, English speakers can recognize that the words ""atomize"" (AE-tuh-mahyz) and ""atomic"" (uh-TOM-ik) are both based on the root ""atom,"" even though the sounds in that root are pronounced differently in the two words. An influential hypothesis is that people store mental representations of the pronunciations of words that abstract away from some finer aspects of their pronunciation. This research aims to make progress towards answering the question of how these mental representations are formed, and how speakers learn the language-specific patterns governing the systematic variation in the pronunciation of related words. The proposed research informs hypotheses regarding the organization of mental representations of words and phonological patterns in children, provides interpretable algorithms and software which can be used for analysis and processing of low-resource languages, and provides insights into sequential processing and learning more generally, which has applications in other fields such as bioinformatics and planning and control systems in robotics.<br/><br/>The leading idea guiding this research is that linguistic generalizations are not arbitrary, and are in fact guided by computational and structural restrictions related to memory and perception. It is well-known that such restrictions can be expressed with particular (called subregular) forms of logic and automata. This research applies a modular, interpretable, and small-data approach to tackle the problem of simultaneously learning the mental representations of words and their morphological and phonological patterning. This research is based on foundational results connecting the computational complexity of morphological and phonological patterns to learning procedures which are specific to subregular logics and automata. Computational analysis of the principles that guide morpho-phonological analysis are combined with algorithms based on subregular properties of morphological and phonological patterning, which are (1) suitably generalized to a variety of morpho-phonological representations and (2) made robust to optionality, variation, and exceptions. The goal is to better understand, qualitatively and computationally, the mechanisms which underlie the human capacities for both constructing mental representations of words and learning the morpho-phonological patterns governing them. Research activities also provide the resulting algorithms as open-source software and evaluate them empirically and quantitatively, with a focus on low-resource languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key drawback of these systems is lack of personalization: since modern AI systems do not know whom they are talking to, they can only give generic answers to user questions. But the answer to the question ?why is the sky blue?? should be different if the person asking the question is a college student or a young child. This project aims to enable an AI model to provide more appropriate responses to users depending on their unique backgrounds, experiences, and needs. It will first gather a diverse dataset in order to characterize what kinds of responses are preferred by different people. The project will then use these data to develop AI systems that can tailor their answers to individual users, as well as evaluate how well the AI systems personalize responses. To achieve this personalization, the AI systems will learn to explicitly represent the kind of person they are talking to, based on their background or previous interactions, and then use this representation to generate an appropriate response. This project will result in AIs that can provide personalized, specific responses based on the person asking the question as well as resources that will help other personalize AIs.  These resources will include datasets of personalized questions and answers, interfaces and visualizations to understand why AI provides specific responses over others; interviews and discussions with community members to understand their needs; and code and models that will allow others to build, train, and deploy personalized AI systems.<br/><br/>While large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets have shown impressive performance on a variety of tasks, they still exhibit biases and struggle to be equally useful for everyone.  While initially pre-trained on a language modeling objective, most LLMs are further fine-tuned to align their outputs with human preferences.  However, existing techniques assume a ?one size fits all? approach, ignoring diversity in user needs. This project will first construct probes to detect cases where models fail to adapt to the diverse needs of different users. Then, this project will develop Personalized Feedback for Diverse Populations (PFDP) to identify when models should be sensitive to the unique needs, knowledge, and background of users by examining the training trajectory of models and comparing models' answers to human preferences. PFDP will enable the development of models that can detect examples that are difficult for computers but not for humans, explain why such disparities in difficulty exist, and represent users? needs and preferences within the model. To correct those shortcomings in the data, we focus on data curation: we propose techniques to automatically create new examples that ask questions about under-represented groups or require targeted responses to create adversarial prompt and response pairs with a human in the loop.  Finally, with these new data, we develop techniques to allow modern architectures to make the most of these difficult (but few) examples.  These techniques will allow for fine-tuning LLMs with a small curated subset of data that is robust to variations in prompts and will lead to the generation of acceptable answers for a diverse population of users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These challenges have been exacerbated due to residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and surging prices of food, gas, and other necessities. This project addresses these issues through the co-development of Second Story Collective (2SC), a novel multi-generational co-housing model that centers the arts to cohere diverse communities.

Identification and characterization of the causal genes and mutations underlying these polygenic traits remain a central challenge in biology. One of the most intriguing examples of polygenic adaptations in plants is the pollination syndrome, a suite of floral traits that enable specialized associations between flowers and their animal pollinators (e.g., bees, hummingbirds, hawkmoths). For example, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are usually large in size, red in color, with copious nectar production and exerted reproductive organs, whereas bee-pollinated flowers usually display various colors (but not red), a smaller quantity of nectar, inserted reproductive organs, and a clear landing platform. Evolutionary transitions from one pollination syndrome to another require coordinated changes of multiple floral traits, with each trait controlled by multiple genes, yet these switches occur rapidly in nature in many plant groups. This study employs a new genetic model system, monkeyflowers, to investigate how pollination syndrome switches occur at the genomic and molecular level. Furthermore, this study integrates research with student education and public outreach through the lens of pollination syndromes. Specific activities include organized pollinator observation experiments in a common garden on the University of Connecticut campus to raise public awareness of animal pollination service, creation of a bioinformatic Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience at Haverford College, and production of professional videos that bring pollination syndrome research to life and that will be released on a highly subscribed YouTube channel, Science IRL (?in real life?).<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to systematically dissect the genomic and molecular bases of floral trait variation among three closely related monkeyflower (Mimulus) species that display three distinct pollination syndromes, including the bee-pollinated M. lewisii, the hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis, and the self-pollinated M. parishii. These species are amenable to fine-scale genetic mapping and rigorous functional interrogation through stable transgenics. We plan to accomplish our overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims: (i) Generate high-quality near-isogenic lines (NILs), which differ from a parental species by only a single floral trait locus introgressed from another species, and use the NILs to genetically dissect each quantitative trait locus (QTL) underlying the pollination syndrome switches. (ii) Functionally characterize the causal genes and mutations under individual QTLs using stable transgenic experiments. (iii) Construct gene regulatory networks/modules that control pollination syndrome component traits using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Results from this study are anticipated to provide an in-depth, genome-wide view of the causal genes underlying pollination syndrome switches, to identify a set of gene regulatory modules controlling individual floral traits that should be widely applicable in other plant systems, and to reveal novel molecular mechanisms that can inform studies of phenotypic evolution in not only plants, but also other organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These essential elements can affect juvenile consumers differently than adult consumers. Such age/stage-specific effects affect population dynamics, suggesting age/stage-structured mathematical models are needed to accurately capture and understand population dynamics. The development of age/stage-structured population models over the decades has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, current models fail when fertility and maturation play important roles in nutrient recycling and ecosystem function.  Here, investigators will design and conduct laboratory experiments in conjunction with developing mathematical models that incorporate age/stage-specific nutritional constraints on growth, time to maturation, and reproduction. This will result in the development of new theoretical applications in ecology that investigate how varying nutrient levels help shape ecological communities. The project is a collaboration between Texas Tech University, Haverford College, and California State University Northridge, and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities. Specifically, undergraduate and graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training and mentorship in the fields of mathematics and ecology to gain the ability to ask, answer, and achieve broad understandings of scientific problems, that is necessary to communicate effectively across disciplines. Investigators and students will be involved in K-12 outreach initiatives. <br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the interactive effects of stoichiometric constraints and population dynamics, particularly, how organismal stage structures and ecosystem function influence each other. To this end, the investigators will develop and analyze a series of empirically testable and robust mathematical models of population dynamics structured under the framework of Ecological Stoichiometry. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry emphasizes the balance of essential elements throughout ecological interactions.  Compartmental systems of ordinary differential equations and delayed integro-differential equations will be developed to address complex questions about stage-specific nutritional constraints, and their consequences on maturation and reproductive output. Dynamical systems theory and tools will be used to interpret and analyze the models including analytical, numerical, as well as bifurcation analysis.  The synthesis of the models and experiments will integrate the field of structured population mathematical modeling with the theory of Ecological Stoichiometry. The resulting theoretical frameworks and their findings will help shed light on the interplay between elemental constraints and stage-structures within ecological systems and broaden the types of ecological questions that models can answer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geohazards can cause loss of human life and destroy infrastructure. Unfortunately, the scientific community has yet to devise a way to forecast these events. This work aims to determine whether measurements of the density of excited vibrational modes (DoM), a technique that has successfully provided a precursor signal to failure in the laboratory context, provide a route forward. To date, this technique has yet to be tested in natural samples. The researchers will develop the technique first in beach sands, then possibly in more complex near-surface environments, including for data already being collected and published by other groups. Professors on the team will lead a diverse group of STEM students across disciplinary boundaries, using best practices developed by experts that emphasize collaborations and mentorship.<br/> <br/>The ground beneath our feet shifts over time, sometimes slowly creeping, sometimes flowing like a fluid, and sometimes suddenly failing. These shifts cause landslides, submarine slides, ground fissures, and liquefaction. These geohazards' frequency and destructive capabilities have increased as global warming worsens, sea levels rise, and extreme weather events intensify. The current state-of-the-art lacks a reliable way to forecast these events, largely due to a lack of reliable methods for incorporating soil-scale information into failure models. This proposal hypothesizes that measurements of the density of excited vibrational modes (DoM), a statistical physics quantity that provides well-established failure precursors signals (broadening and increase in excess of low-frequency modes) within lab-reconstituted and numerically simulated granular materials, provides a route forward. The work seeks to answer the following questions: ?How do DoM measurements complement and correspond to bulk geophysical measurements?? and ?Does the DoM provide insight into the evolving state of naturally-deposited sediments??  These efforts would represent the first application of the DoM technique in the natural sediments; if successful, the translation of the technique to Earth settings would provide a new way to identify and monitor slope stability-related hazards within the near surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If understood at the molecular level, these protein assemblies hold tremendous potential to provide sustainable access to important chemical commodities. This project will engage undergraduate students in the study of the evolution of these assemblies, in identifying the features that confer function and stability upon these assemblies, and in the engineering of new assemblies that have the potential to catalyze the synthesis of novel molecules.

Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for the investigation of a diverse array of molecular systems. Effective use of this tool requires a clear and deep understanding of the vibrations within molecules that are associated with the absorption of light with specific amounts of energy. Alkynes, molecules with carbon-carbon triple bonds, have recently been used in Raman spectroscopy to understand the structure and dynamics of proteins that cells use to make new molecules. This new use of alkynes highlights the need to more deeply understand alkyne vibrations and thus their Raman spectroscopic signals. In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Clyde Daly and his students at Haverford College will develop relationships called ?spectroscopic maps? between the Raman absorption of alkyne molecules and their molecular environments. These maps can be used in molecular simulations to better understand how cells make new molecules, relevant to the design of new drugs and materials. This project will also advance computational and experimental uses of Raman spectroscopy.  The methods developed during this project will be used to build educational materials for advanced and first year courses related to vibrational spectroscopy.  Engagement in the research of students from backgrounds underrepresented in Mathematical and Physical Sciences fields will be prioritized through avenues such as payment for work-study (disproportionately low-income or first-generation college students) and recruitment of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduate students in the development of a vibrational spectroscopic map for terminal alkyne containing molecules at Haverford College. The carbon-carbon triple bond stretching vibration of terminal alkynes has been increasingly used as a Raman vibrational probe to understand proteins, other biological molecules, and materials. A spectroscopic map will enable the calculation of Raman spectra from molecular dynamics simulations. The process of building the spectroscopic map will also uncover the reasons for the substantial Raman frequency shift of the vibration of interest between different solvation environments. The aims for this project are threefold: (1) create a spectroscopic map that is appropriate for answering biophysical questions related to the acyl carrier protein relevant to our collaborators; (2) advance the paradigm of spectroscopic map design to include machine learning more fully as a tool and universality as a goal; (3) understand the factors that lead to Raman frequency shifts in terminal alkynes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fake profiles may use face images to signal human authenticity. Until recently it was possible to identify bad-faith actors via reverse image searches because many fake profiles used stock photos. Recent advances in machine learning-enabled general adversarial networks (GANs) have made it possible to create hyper-realistic faces of people who do not exist and cannot be identified. These faces can be animated and used to cause harm. To help develop more secure and trustworthy cyberspaces, it is critical to understand whether and how human perceivers (alone or with computational aids) can detect real vs. artificial faces, and how their detection strategies and outcomes differ across groups. This project investigates whether the GANs that generate faces are racially biased and whether this bias is manifested in differential detectability of ingroup vs. outgroup faces. <br/><br/>The project tests the hypothesis that GANs are racially biased because the training dataset is itself biased, with White faces (especially White female faces) overrepresented. Furthermore, when tools are created to control what kind of face is generated, these tools may be racially biased as well because they are extracting biased parameters. These biased processes may result in GAN-generated faces that are more detectable to racial minority individuals vs. racial majority individuals. To test these hypotheses, the project is developing a training dataset of diverse faces, with annotations for dimensions of interest such as skin tone and gender. These annotations can be used to train a GAN with any number of checkpoints to examine how GAN-generated faces appear at different stages of creation. The project is examining how people perceive the generated faces at each stage of the GAN. This project is helping spur theoretical insights into how machine-learning works, and provides training in computer science and social psychology for a diverse group of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symmetric organisms persist through evolution in nature, symmetric protagonists are perceived as especially beautiful in art, and symmetric components are critical to engineering structures that can withstand powerful forces. The set of symmetries of a particular physical object enjoys a rich algebraic structure, because symmetries are operations that can be composed together.  This group of all symmetries can then be conveniently studied by encoding each symmetry as a rectangular array of numbers called a matrix.  This process of passing from a symmetric object in the natural world to a related collection of matrices is the hallmark of the mathematical field of representation theory. Representation theory thus reduces the complex study of symmetry in nature to questions in the well understood area of mathematics called linear algebra. As such, the proposed projects have broad potential to substantially impact our understanding of many symmetric structures occurring throughout the mathematical and natural sciences. This project also provides opportunities for directly involving undergraduate students in mathematical research, with a focused goal of supporting the development and recruitment of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project will address two topics in the algebra, geometry, and representation theory of reductive algebraic groups over non-archimedean local fields.  First, applying techniques from geometric group theory to the associated Bruhat-Tits building, the investigator will provide a global approach to understanding the conjugacy classes of any affine Weyl group.  Second, this geometric perspective will also be applied to reinterpret the K-theoretic generalization of Peterson's isomorphism from the equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian to the equivariant quantum cohomology of a finite flag variety.  Specific objectives include a complete description of an affine conjugacy class in terms of the underlying finite Weyl group, and new representatives for the Schubert classes in the equivariant K-homology of the affine Grassmannian.  As such, the research will stimulate new interactions among the mathematical subfields of representation theory, arithmetic geometry, enumerative geometry, algebraic combinatorics, geometric group theory, and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The way children represent these groups in their minds often serves as the basis for negative outcomes such as stereotyping and biased behavior. However, the people children interact with do not belong to only one group; they are simultaneously part of multiple groups. This perspective is not often recognized, and even more rarely adopted in prior research. Recognizing and incorporating this perspective in research is important because it illuminates unique forms of bias faced by people who have multiple marginalized identities.  This project will investigate how children integrate information about multiple groups and how the processes underlying that integration may differ across early childhood. Specifically, the project will examine how low-level perceptual cues (e.g., facial femininity) and higher-level conceptual knowledge (e.g., beliefs about the category) shape how children integrate information about multiple categories in their representations of others. Investigating these processes is critical in order to develop a framework for predicting at what ages different types of interventions to pre-empt bias might be most effective. <br/><br/>The project tests the hypothesis that perceptual cues (e.g., facial features) are more influential in shaping categorization processes for younger, preschool-aged children, but that conceptual knowledge about groups is more influential for older children. The project uses novel adaptations of social-cognitive methods used with adult samples for use with children. Children will be shown pictures of people?s faces that differ in gender and racial background and asked to make a gender categorization. This project will help spur theoretical innovations about how children parse the social world, as well as create pipelines for research dissemination and community involvement via partnerships with community-based institutions.

Why do the beach-goers not sink into the sandy depths? Though we have the experience to understand that sands, powders, and other granular systems will flow like a fluid or support load like a rigid solid under certain conditions, nobody can reliably or precisely predict when, how, or why these systems will become rigid or flowing. This uncertainty is characteristic of a broad class of rigid, amorphous materials. Examples include sand as well as glass and plastics. Thus, by studying the origins of rigidity in granular materials, the principal investigator hopes to gain insight into a wide variety of systems. The focus of this project is the transmission of stress through the internal structure of a granular material is related to the bulk mechanical response of the material. The research team uses an imaging technique to measure the forces between particles throughout the material. The primary goal is to identify structures, not in the particles' spatial arrangement, but the patterns of force transmitted through the system. To understand these structures, the team leverages new methods to describe complicated networks and geometries. A secondary goal of the project is to manipulate these force-transmission structures to design materials with specific properties. The project will contribute to several educational goals, as well. Specifically, the principal investigator will provide training and mentorship to undergraduate and postdoctoral junior scientists involved in the research and integrate experimental techniques and ongoing research within the project's scope into the core physics curriculum. Additionally, the principal investigator will develop a workshop that prepares research mentors to train a diverse and effective population of junior scientists.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to understand the multi-scale origins of rigidity in amorphous granular materials. The research team will leverage photoelasticimetric imaging, a state of the art spatially- and force-resolved measurement technique, combined with high-resolution, composite imaging to characterize the structure and internal stress state of large granular packings in either biaxial compression or pure shear. The project's primary goal is to identify correlations between the bulk mechanical response of the material and the force-resolved measurements of the material's internal stress state. Prior observations suggest that structures at all scales contribute to the mechanical response of granular materials. Thus, both mean-field descriptions and particle-scale metrics are ill-suited to predicting material rigidity. In contrast, the principal investigator is developing a novel analytic approach based on algebraic topology and the science of networks, which identifies topological features that represent structures at all length-scales. To identify correlations between these topological features and the bulk material response, the research team uses the Support Vector Machines method. This machine learning technique has been effective in predicting local plasticity in colloidal glasses and wet, granular pillars. A secondary goal of the project is to develop strategies for materials design to reproducibly manufacture packings with prescribed topological properties in an approach reminiscent of the design of topologically insulating electronic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advancements in analytical techniques have revealed that many host-bacterial interactions are tightly regulated by small molecules, acting as chemical messengers. Yet, connecting how these interactions at the cellular level translate to impacts on whole communities and ecosystems remains an ongoing challenge necessitating cross-disciplinary collaboration. A newly emerging picture suggests that marine bacteria are not passive in their interactions with hosts such as algae; rather bacteria actively mediate the flow of organic matter depending on how they deploy their chemical arsenal. The assembled interdisciplinary team will develop new methods to track and translate complex chemical signals between a model algal host and associated bacteria. New methodologies in fluorescent biosensors will quantify bacterial production of chemical signals at the cellular level, whose release manipulates host physiology. How the host responds to the chemicals will be assessed by measuring changes in the host's proteins, RNA, and metabolites. This work supports the training and mentoring of underrepresented/underresourced postdoctoral and undergraduate trainees in themes bridging the chemical, biological, and environmental sciences. Four postdoctoral investigators will participate in course-based undergraduate research experiences with Haverford faculty with the goal of building supportive scholar-teacher mentoring networks with students and providing training in equitable and inclusive course design so that the scholars becoming more reflective, engaged, and effective teachers. All four PIs will develop conference-based experiential workshops to provide career development.<br/><br/>Microbes have emerged as key players in marine systems where they form complex relationships with eukaryotic phytoplankton. These interactions range from symbiotic to pathogenic and are tightly regulated through the dynamic exchange of small molecule chemical messengers that shape communities and influence the biogeochemical fate of oceanic nutrients. Efforts to elucidate the exchange of chemical signals and decipher the environmental drivers of bacterial-phytoplankton interactions are limited and met with substantial technical challenges. Recently, two chemical messengers, tetrabromopyrrole (TBP) and 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), both produced by the globally distributed marine gamma proteobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, have been identified to govern the physiology of its associated, bloom-forming single-cell algal host, Emiliania huxleyi, with contrasting modalities. Experiments outlined in this study are poised to tease apart the metabolic landscape defining this model host-bacterial symbiosis, and detail when and how chemical messengers induce host metabolic reprogramming resulting in ecosystem level consequences. Three synergistic aims will be accomplished: in the first, TBP and HHQ production and uptake will be measured in response to nutrient variability and HHQ production will be captured at the single-cell level using biosensors. In the second aim, experiments will reveal metabolic cross-talk by establishing the metabolomic and proteomic response of E. huxleyi to both P. piscicida and HHQ, while tracking P. piscicida uptake of E. huxleyi-derived metabolites. In the third, experiments will investigate if HHQ prevents E. huxleyi viral entry using electron microscopy, accounting for an earlier observation that viral-induced mortality of E. huxleyi is stalled in the presence of HHQ.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A grammar formalism with the expressive power to generate all the grammatical patterns found in the languages of the world without generating the non-occurring patterns would facilitate the comparison of different linguistic theories and allow precise claims to be made about the bounds of linguistic complexity.  This workshop has two aims. The first is to take stock of existing work in FLT and its impact on theories of language and of its learnability, and to showcase new directions in which this work is headed. The second is to bring together linguists and computer scientists in order to establish deeper points of contact between their goals and methods as they relate to how both humans and machines can learn and use language, and to identify the most fruitful directions for moving forward.

A key objective in Teichmuller theory is to understand all possible geometric forms that a fixed type of surface can admit. For example, an astrophysicist might be interested in cataloging all possible topographies of a hypothetical planet. The possibilities are countless: there could be hilly or mountainous terrains, highlands, valleys of varying elevations, and so forth. Miraculously, Teichmuller theory gives a way to package the entire plethora of possible topographies into one geometric object which can then be studied.

For example, the PI plans to demonstrate relationships between the curve complex of a surface S and the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over S, in such a way that is sensitive to the topology of the underlying surface S.

Chemists often use optical spectrometers (instruments that measure how molecules absorb, emit or scatter light)to obtain information about molecular structure. But as proteins are large molecules (hundreds or thousands of atoms) that are also flexible, it is very difficult to determine their structures from optical spectroscopy alone.  In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Casey Londergan of Haverford College is using a combination of experimental spectroscopy and computational chemistry to develop ""vibrational probe"" techniques for the determination of the structures and internal motions of proteins.  A vibrational probe is a small molecule that vibrates at a known frequency (typically corresponding to infrared light) when it is isolated, but exhibits a change in frequency when it interacts with other molecules (including other probes). One such probe being investigated is thiocyanate, which contains sulfur, carbon and nitrogen (SCN). By attaching SCN or other vibrational probes to different parts of the protein, Prof. Londergan hypothesizes that the changes in probe frequencies can be associated with changes in their local probe environment.  In principle, the vibrational probes thus report on local regions of the proteins and their interactions with other parts of the protein or with other molecules (water, dissolved ions, etc.). However, in order to interpret the experimentally observed probe frequency changes, computer simulations of the different protein shapes and local environments is necessary. This project is being conducted mainly by undergraduate students and is providing them with an interdisciplinary research experience with a network of local and international collaborators. This project also includes educational outreach activities, for example dance-based workshops and instructions designed to engender a more human-level understanding of proteins and their interactions. <br/><br/>This research project is focusing on a model regulatory protein (calmodulin), a model membrane protein (alpha-synuclein), and other proteins at the center of bacterial biosynthesis.  Well-sampled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to propose ensembles of structures, and then further simulations with vibrational probe groups explicitly included to produce simulated spectral lineshapes that can validate or help to re-weight the simulated structural ensembles.  The initial model associations between measured spectra and local probe environments are being developed based on the relatively broadly-used SCN probe group. As the methodology improves in accuracy, it will ultimately be used to provide quantitative interpretation of new data from less-used probe groups that this project will develop (e.g.,azido, isonitrile, alkyne, and nitro groups). Some of these novel probe groups' signals are more easily collected by Raman spectroscopy rather than infrared absorption.  This project's development of a quantitative vibrational probe methodology is likely to enable solutions to many important biomolecular problems where current data are underdetermined for representing the conformational distribution, which is of central importance in disordered and ""fuzzy"" protein systems(most of which are regulatory and/or disease-related species).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deep-time history of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere may help us quantify the role of this greenhouse gas in abrupt climate change events in the geological past, giving a better perspective towards climate projections under future scenarios of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This project will refine proxy estimates of atmospheric carbon dioxide that are based on an understanding of how the properties of stomatal pores in the leaves of Ginkgo trees respond to elevated carbon dioxide concentration. This proxy relationship, established using controlled experiments on cultivated Ginkgo leaves, will then be applied to the ancient record of atmospheric carbon dioxide using fossil Ginkgo leaves that are common in sediments deposited during periods when Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and climate varied substantially. These more precise estimates of ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide will thus help to refine our understanding of the sensitivity of Earth's climate system to greenhouse gas concentrations and facilitate more accurate projections of changes in climate, ice volume and sea level that will result from anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. More accurate projections of these future scenarios will have significant societal and economic implications for infrastructure and food production. The project will also educate students and citizen scientists about the scientific method and insights from this research by involving them in collecting specimens, making measurements and analyzing data.<br/><br/>Sensitivity of global temperature to atmospheric pCO2 is difficult to determine by direct atmospheric measurements because feedbacks in the Earth system play out over millennia or longer. This research will develop a reliable, temporally dense proxy record of pCO2 for the late Paleocene and Early Eocene period of warm climates (~60-53 Ma) using stomatal properties of fossil Ginkgo leaves. The researchers will first refine a proxy relationship between Ginkgo leaf stomatal properties, and then apply this proxy to dense and temporally well-constrained fossil records of Ginkgo.  To establish the response of modern Ginkgo to elevated pCO2 concentrations, trees will be cultivated under experimental conditions at three elevated CO2 concentrations in open-top chambers, while monitoring stomatal density, size and index, as well as carbon isotopic composition and rates of photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration, temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation. These data from experimental cultivation will be used along with survey data of modern Ginkgo leaves, to allow the researchers to evaluate modeled relationships between paleo-pCO2 and fossil stomata. Once this response is calibrated for modern Ginkgo biloba, the results will be applied to extensive collections of fossil Ginkgo wyomingensis from the terrestrial sediments of the Paleogene in the Rocky Mountains. This record, combined with records of paleotemperature from the marine and terrestrial realms will be used to evaluate the role of atmospheric CO2 during episodes of geologically rapid temperature increases (hyperthermals).  Better estimates of paleo-pCO2 will contribute substantially to refining our understanding of Earth's climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide and increase our understanding of controls on past warm climates in the geological record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports research and education that uses data-centric methods to enable the prediction of metal oxide compounds with desired properties. Organically-templated metal oxides have a tremendous degree of structural diversity and compositional flexibility. This allows chemists to tune the structures, properties, and symmetries of these compounds to optimize their performance in specific applications that include catalysis, molecular sieving, gas adsorption, and nonlinear optics.  However, new compounds are typically created by a trial-and-error procedure, and creating novel compounds with specific structures is a grand challenge in solid state chemistry.  This project will develop artificial intelligence techniques for computers called machine learning techniques that can be used to predict the conditions for chemical reactions that will increase structural diversity and lead to specific structural features.  This project will also develop machine learning techniques that generate human-readable explanations about the formation mechanism, which will be tested in the laboratory.<br/> <br/>The primary impact of this project will be to decrease the amount of time and to lower the cost of discovering new materials with specific structural features, which in turn help bring new materials for applications to market more quickly.  This project is an example of a collaboration among synthetic chemists, computational chemists, and computer scientists and as a model it may be directly transferred to a wide range of disciplines and avenues of investigation.

This award supports research and education that uses data-centric methods to enable the prediction of metal oxide compounds with desired properties. Hydrothermal synthesis is widely used to create new metal oxide materials with a wide range of functional properties and applications.  This project will advance the field by developing software infrastructure for associating the results of X-ray diffraction experiments with individual reactions, extracting structural outcome descriptors from this data, and then determining the extent to which these structural outcomes can be predicted from reaction description data.  This will be achieved by developing structural outcome descriptors for geometric properties, non-covalent interaction properties, and electron-density properties, then building machine learning models that correlate these outcomes to reaction conditions, and finally testing the quality of these predictions experimentally.  Active learning and auditable and interpretable models will be incorporated into the workflows to help synthetic chemists select better (more insightful/novel) reactions in an interactive fashion."

While it has been established that interactions between these two domains are complex, the mechanisms that underpin these interactions remain largely unknown. There is increasing recognition, however, that dissolved chemical cues govern these microbial interactions. This project focuses on establishing a mechanistic framework for how bacterially derived signaling molecules influence interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria. The quorum-sensing (QS) molecule, 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ) will be used as a model compound for these investigations. Previously published work suggests that exposure to very low levels of HHQ results in phytoplankton mortality. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of these ecologically important interactions will help to inform mathematical models for the accurate prediction of the cycling of material through the marine microbial loop. This work initiates a new, hybrid workshop-internship undergraduate research program in chemical ecology, with a focus into bacteria-phytoplankton interactions. Undergraduate students participate in an intense summer learning experience where research and field-based exercises are supplemented with short-lecture based modules. Students return to their home institutions and work closely with the PIs to conduct interdisciplinary research relating to the aims and scope of the summer research. This research also provides training and career development to two graduate students and a postdoctoral scientist.<br/><br/>Interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria play a central role in mediating biogeochemical cycling and microbial trophic structure in the ocean. The intricate relationships between these two domains of life are mediated via excreted molecules that facilitate communication and determine competitive outcomes. Despite their predicted importance, identifying these released compounds has remained a challenge. The PIs recently identified a bacterial QS molecule, HHQ, produced by globally distributed marine gamma-proteobacteria, which induces phytoplankton mortality. The PIs therefore hypothesize that bacteria QS signals are critical drivers of phytoplankton population dynamics and, ultimately, biogeochemical fluxes. This project investigates the timing and magnitude of HHQ production, and the physiological and transcriptomic responses of susceptible phytoplankton species to HHQ exposure, and quantifies the influence of HHQ on natural algal and bacterial assemblages. The work connects laboratory and field-based experiments to understand the governance of chemical signaling on marine microbial interactions, and has the potential to yield broadly applicable insights into how microbial interactions influence biogeochemical fluxes in the marine environment."

These bacterial species are evaluated as a source of PKS enzymes that can be expressed in tractable heterologous hosts to enable in vitro characterization of poorly understood type II PKSs.  Finally, acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) representing diverse stages of PKS evolution are characterized using a combination of traditional and innovative biochemical and biophysical methods. Results will lead to the identification of new chemical diversity encoded by nature, as well as new tools to enable the biosynthetic engineering of hybrid PKSs.  The work also includes the student-led annotation of uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters, a professional development series to expose students to post-graduation career opportunities in the sciences, and BioArt outreach activities that leverage the pigmented nature of polyketide-producing bacteria.

The tools of data analysis are being harnessed to predict crime, select candidates for jobs, identify security threats, determine credit risk, and even decide treatment plans and interventions for patients. Automated learning and mining tools can crunch incredible amounts and variety of data in order to detect patterns and make predictions. As is rapidly becoming clear, these tools can also introduce discriminatory behavior and amplify biases in the systems they are trained on. In this project, the PIs will study the problems of discrimination and bias in algorithmic decision-making. By studying all aspects of the data pipeline (from data preparation to learning, evaluation, and feedback), they will develop tools for analyzing, auditing, and designing automated decision-making systems that will be fair, accountable, and transparent. As specific goals to broaden the impact of this research, the PIs will develop a course curriculum to educate the next generation of data scientists on the ethical, legal, and societal implications of algorithmic decision-making, with the intent that they will then take this understanding into their jobs as they enter the workforce. Initial efforts by the PIs have attracted students from underrepresented groups in computer science, and they will continue these efforts. The PIs will also explore the legal and policy ramifications of this research, and develop best practice guidelines for the use of their tools by policy makers, lawyers, journalists, and other practitioners.<br/><br/>The PIs will explore the technical subject of this project in three ways. Firstly, they will develop a sound theoretical framework for reasoning about algorithmic fairness. This framework carefully separates mechanisms, beliefs, and assumptions in order to make explicit implicitly held assumptions about the nature of fairness in learning. Secondly, by examining the entire pipeline of tasks associated with learning, they will identify hitherto unexplored areas where bias may be unintentionally introduced into learning as well as novel problems associated with ensuring fairness. These include the initial stages of data preparation, various kinds of fairness-aware learning, and evaluation. They will also investigate the problem of feedback: when actions based on a biased learned model might cause a feedback loop that changes reality and leads to more bias."

The human mind has evolved a capacity to continually self-monitor, checking ongoing performance against goals, maintaining alertness to possible errors, and rapidly adjusting attention when performance shows signs of slipping. The present research project will investigate the processes by which performance errors are detected, leading to heightened physiological arousal and adaptive changes in cognition that momentarily refocus attention on task-relevant information in the environment. Using both EEG measures of brain activity and measures of pupil diameter to quantify physiological arousal, the research will test the hypothesis that arousal elicited by performance errors leads to enhanced attention. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will strengthen the research environment in cognitive neuroscience at a highly selective liberal arts college that sends disproportionate numbers of graduates on to doctoral-level research in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Effective control of cognitive performance depends on noticing and responding to performance errors in ways that are behaviorally adaptive. The proposed research tests a novel model of error-reactivity that focuses on error-related alpha suppression (ERAS), which refers to the reduction in EEG alpha-band activity in the inter-trial interval following an error compared to a correct response. The model posits that ERAS reflects transient arousal resulting from norepinephrine projections that ascend from the brainstem locus coerulus to activate cortical regions in response to salient events. The arousal model predicts that ERAS should covary with error-related pupil dilation, which is mediated by the norepinephrine system. In addition, based on adaptive gain theory, the model predicts that error-related arousal leads to enhanced attention to task-relevant cues, which will be measured both behaviorally and with EEG measures. Finally, using current time-frequency analysis techniques, the research will directly compare ERAS to other error-related oscillatory phenomena that are present in different EEG frequency bands (i.e., error-related theta and gamma effects). Results will provide novel information to inform theories of error-related cognitive control by detailing how performance mistakes lead to momentary arousal responses and by examining the relationship between error-related arousal and behavioral performance."

The wave-like functions that analogously serve as building blocks of analysis on other spaces are known as eigenfunctions and are central in disciplines ranging from spectral geometry to quantum mechanics. This project will investigate the behavior of rapidly oscillating eigenfunctions on spaces with a rich set of symmetries that are arithmetic in nature, in particular how pronounced are their extreme values.<br/><br/>This research project centers around two principal themes, that of extremal behavior of high-energy eigenfunctions on arithmetic manifolds and that of the depth and smooth aspects in analytic number theory. On certain arithmetic manifolds with a specific geometric and functorial structure, the joint eigenfunctions (Hecke--Maass eigenforms) exhibit power growth, which is neither generically expected nor predicted by physical models. The PI will seek out extremal growth and investigate in detail the sup-norm and restriction norm problems on several specific classes of arithmetic manifolds to inform general conjectures and understanding of the phenomenon of concentration of mass on arithmetic manifolds, the precise structure that drives it, and its place within the framework of the correspondence principle of quantum mechanics. In number-theoretic problems involving characters and automorphic forms of large level, the depth and smooth aspects, which are concerned with highly powerful or factorable conductors, play a very distinctive role. The structural impact of the powerful or factorable structure on nonvanishing, subconvexity, and moments of L-functions, as well as exponential sums involving p-adically analytic fluctuations will be studied using non-archimedean analysis, analytic number theory, and spectral theory."

The proposed research examines whether identity development is key to understanding these educational and developmental trajectories. Although research has shown that the establishment of a clear and positive identity during emerging adulthood is associated with a variety of optimal outcomes, many questions remain regarding how identity is formed, particularly with regard to developing a positive science identity and a sense of belonging with one's STEM field. The overarching goal of the current project is to better understand how identity forms during college by applying a narrative approach, in which identity is understood as developing through a subjective process of integrating life experiences into a personal and self-defining story. Specifically, the unique vantage point of narratives will be used to better understand why some students -- especially women, underrepresented minorities, and those with disadvantaged backgrounds -- disengage from pursuing STEM-related careers while others persist. By combining objective markers (e.g., gender, ethnicity, SES, educational background) with coded narratives that emerge in response to relevant experiences (e.g., in the science classroom), this study may contribute to solutions for the persistent lack of diversity in the sciences. More broadly, by examining how students engage in meaning-making about the critical transitions (e.g., leaving home, choosing a major) and contextualized experiences (e.g., academic, social, romantic) that are central to college life, the proposed research will identify the identity pathways that contribute to increases over time in other important outcomes, including maturity, happiness, and clarity of career goals.<br/><br/>The Identity Pathways Project is a five-year, two-campus longitudinal study that utilizes a quantitative narrative approach. The longitudinal design involves three surveys annually for four years and a final survey one year after graduation. The surveys will include repeated assessments of both narratives (transition to college, academic and relational high and low points, experiences related to major choice and future career) and standard scales of the outcomes of interest. With this design, the proposed research will be able to test the extent to which identity processes operate as mechanisms of developmental change, and more specifically, whether narratives reflecting a positive science identity are a key factor in persistence along a STEM-related career path. The two-campus design, which includes a private liberal arts college and a state university, increases the demographic diversity and allows for a more inclusive examination of identity development, especially as it pertains to career identity and STEM participation. The narrative approach to career identity has important implications for designing career counseling programs, especially those promoting STEM-related career paths among women and minorities."

The processes will be measured in gardens that include both transplants and plants exposed to warming with open-top chambers to simulate the combined effects of northward migration of southern ecotypes and climate warming."

Polygonal meshes have become the industry standard for the representation of surfaces with highly complex geometry and arbitrary genus in computer graphics and geometry processing applications. While triangle meshes are the most popular type of mesh representation for surfaces, quadrilateral meshes are better suited than triangle meshes in several applications such as character animation, texture mapping, spline-based surface modeling, mesh compression, and some specific finite element analysis applications. Provably good algorithms for generating triangle meshes from surfaces given by parametric or implicit functions or as point point clouds are widely available. However, algorithms to generate quadrilateral meshes with provable quality guarantees for such surfaces are not as prevalent, in part because the problem of generating a quadrilateral mesh from a given surface is intrinsically harder than its triangular counterpart. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms for quadrilateral meshes for various surface representations with provable guarantees on element quality as measured by commonly used metrics such as angle bounds or aspect ratio, and mesh quality as measured by mesh size or anisotropy. Direct and indirect methods (which generate a quad mesh from a triangle mesh), as well as parameterization guided methods will be utilized. Techniques from computational geometry and graph theory will play a central role in the design and development of algorithms. <br/><br/>The automated generation of provably good quadrilateral meshes for surfaces is a fundamental problem that is of interest both in theory, as it raises several geometric, combinatorial, and graph-theoretic questions, as well as practice, where the computational pipeline from designing a model for the surface to the end stage of simulation or animation is frequently dominated by the meshing process. A formal understanding of these questions is critical not only for the theoretical underpinnings of automated mesh generation, but also for the sound practice of utilizing the meshes in a wide range of applications. <br/><br/>As a collaborative effort between PIs at three undergraduate institutions, involvement of undergraduate students in research projects is an integral part of this project. An important and particular goal for this project is the creation of a larger peer group for female and minority undergraduate Computer Science majors by providing opportunities for collaboration and joint research projects between students across all three institutions. Through early and active involvement of undergraduates in the project, the PIs also seek to create a pipeline of female and minority students bound for graduate school in Computer Science."

To address these needs, the Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership (PRNP) consisting of Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, Drexel University, La Salle University, the University of Pennsylvania, Saint Joseph's University and Temple University, together with the Philadelphia Education Fund and its Philadelphia Teacher Residency Program will develop a new teacher support program that will provide flexible, individualized supportive services to new first and second year Noyce teachers so as to increase their persistence and professional growth as STEM professionals in the Philadelphia region. The Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership will develop a model of early career teacher support using regional resources that will retain and sustain new STEM teachers.  These new Noyce teachers will have increased opportunities to participate in mentoring, professional development, communities of practice and social networks with regional STEM professionals in real and virtual environments. The new teacher support model will include the following components: (1) Individualized Support Plan (ISP); (2) Mentoring (Mentor Training Model Development, Mentor Training and Mentoring Support); (3) Professional Development; (4) Outreach and Networking; and (5) Website Based Resources and Communication.<br/><br/>The proposed activities will contribute to the subfield within STEM education focused on preparing,retaining, and supporting the development of high quality teachers in high needs settings. Specifically, through developing and testing an approach that supports both new teachers' emotional well-being and their instructional outlook and skills, the project will increase understanding of the challenges confronted by novice teachers in a large urban school district and ways that those challenges can be managed and met. By the end of the two-year project, there will be a refined regional model of new STEM teacher support that can be scaled to provide support for large numbers of new teachers. In addition to providing support for new STEM teachers working in high-needs schools in Philadelphia, to  increase their capacities as teachers and the likelihood that they will stay in teaching, the project will prepare experienced STEM teachers to serve as mentors of new teachers, enhancing the self-sustaining capacity of the network of teachers in Philadelphia. The project will strengthen a growing partnership across seven teacher education institutions in Philadelphia, facilitating regional cooperation efforts devoted to teacher development and support. Finally, through collaborative efforts, the partnership will offer a rich menu of supports for all new STEM teachers in the region, exceeding the capacity of any single institution to support its graduates."

The goal of this project is to achieve a better understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between geometry and topology, thereby strengthening the foundation for the aforementioned applications.  The project's research activities will increase participation and mentoring of students from undergraduate institutions in the critical STEM pipeline.  The project's activities will also encourage the exchange of ideas between faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, thereby providing additional means of bringing undergraduates into the research process.  Research with undergraduates will also serve as a pedagogical laboratory for integrating ideas arising in mathematical research into the PI's courses at all levels of the curriculum.<br/><br/>Approaching symplectic topology (and its sister field contact topology) through a topological lens has given rise to a young and thriving discipline with interesting questions that explore the boundary between flexibility (when the symplectic world behaves topologically) and rigidity (when the symplectic world behaves geometrically). This project sets forth a program to answer fundamental flexibility and rigidity questions about Legendrian and Lagrangian submanifolds. A number of the projects are concrete and easy to explain, and hence appeal to the imagination of a wide mathematical audience. The proposed research is framed by three themes.  The first is a focus on the global properties of the space of Legendrian submanifolds, with specific goals of introducing new quantitative techniques into the study of Lagrangian cobordisms and beginning the study of homotopy groups of spaces of higher dimensional Legendrians.  The second theme seeks to link Legendrian and smooth topology, using the Lagrangian cobordism relation to give meaning to certain quantum knot invariants and the conormal construction to connect Legendrian and smooth invariants.  The final theme emphasizes investigations into the scope and structure of Legendrian invariants, with one project, in particular, poised to uncover a new type of algebraic pattern for Legendrian Contact Homology."

The team will use these coupled codes to create a library of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated, evolving, and merging galaxies. They will then fold the resulting models through estimates of cosmological merger rates and merging histories obtained through semi-analytic and numerical methods. This strategy will make it possible to connect physical mechanisms operating on scales of tens of parsecs to observations from large-scale galaxy surveys.

Despite this simplicity, the formation of crystalline products depends sensitively on the quantities of reagents used and the reaction conditions, which makes this a demanding test case for predicting success or failure of the reaction.  Moreover, unlike other systems such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), the many different types of intermolecular interactions that are present result in highly diverse crystal structures which cannot be predicted a priori.  <br/>Rather than predicting a final crystal structure, we aim to address the simpler problem of whether a reaction will yield any crystalline product or not.  Our project will address this with three strategies: We propose constructing a searchable online repository for ""dark reactions"", the chemical reactions that have been performed and recorded in laboratory notebooks, but never reported in the literature. This begins with putting our own reactions online, then the reactions of selected experimental collaborators, and finally creating a web-accessible public repository for depositing, retrieving, and utilizing reaction information.  Using this data, we propose using machine learning to derive predictions to increase the success rate of performing novel reactions.   From the experimental reaction data, we use cheminformatics calculations to predict >200 computed properties of the individual reagents (e.g., van der Waals surface areas, polar surface areas as a function of pH, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, etc.)  and compute 50 stoichiometric descriptors (e.g., ratios of organic and inorganic components, weighted by hydrogen bond donor/acceptors as a function of pH, etc.). Based on a preliminary dataset of 506 reactions, we have been able to train a decision tree model to achieve an 87% success rate in predicting whether a crystalline product is formed or not. During this project, we will make the improved model publicly available (via the web), address weaknesses in the physicochemical model, and integrate this with databases of commercially available starting materials.   Finally, we will perform experimental validation to demonstrate a proof-of-principle synthesis of new compounds, address structural holes in the dataset, and engage with the broader research community to guide experiments in other laboratories for the synthesis of new materials and addressing limitations in the chemical space of our model.  Besides the impact on this specific area of materials synthesis, the software architecture that we develop will serve as a starting point for others to begin similar projects and we commit to freely distributing our work to others by open-sourcing our code under a license that will allow its free use in academic settings. <br/>	<br/><br/>Non-technical Summary:  <br/><br/>Organically-templated metal oxide framework compounds have outstanding structural and chemical diversity, which lends them to applications for industrial catalysis, gas separation, and optical engineering.  Yet, despite several decades of experimental effort, making new examples of these materials is a time-consuming trial-and-error process.  Most of the chemical reactions that have been performed are deemed ""unsuccessful"" because they do not result in a crystalline product, and are never reported in the literature.  There is no forum for collecting these experiments, nor a means for deriving value from them.  Nevertheless, these ""dark reactions"" are valuable because they define the bounds on the reaction conditions needed to successfully produce a product. By providing a searchable online repository for reaction data, we will enable better management and sharing of these dark reactions.  Moreover, we will use this data as a resource to train machine learning (aka statistical learning or data-mining) algorithms that predict the success of reactions ahead of time.  Based on the machine learning predictions, we will perform experimental validation to test the predictions of the model.<br/>Our project will provide a mechanism for collecting the dark reactions and then using them to guide future reactions to be more successful, reducing the researcher time and cost of reagents needed to synthesize new materials.  This will accelerate and lower the cost (in researcher time and materials) of discovering new materials.  This directly addresses the call of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's 2011 Materials Genome Initiative, specifically finding ways to use computation to bring functional materials to market more quickly.  Second, this project will serve as a model for collaboration between chemists and computer scientists that can be directly transferred to a wide range of other disciplines and avenues of investigation.  Third, we will provide a cohesive, comprehensive, interdisciplinary and sustained research experience for undergraduate students, thus contributing to the scientific workforce.  Fourth, our outreach activities will foster interest in data-driven techniques, create a network of collaborating laboratories and provide the software infrastructure to others wishing to initiate related projects."

They use specific surface proteins to adhere to one another, and to host cells, to form a stable community of bacteria that are not washed away.  In this research, mentored undergraduate students, will identify and characterize protein colonization factors and determine how they interact with one another.  Hra1 was previously described as a member of the agglutinin family of outer surface proteins which by self-association mediates adjacent bacterial cells to adhere to one another.  Hra1 also mediates in vivo binding of Escherichia coli to eukaryotic cells and specifically promotes colonization of nematode worm intestines in small aggregates.   There is preliminary evidence that suggests that a second protein, Aap, prevents Hra1 mediated interactions.  The inhibitory activity of Aap provides a mechanism for restricting Hra1 mediated associations as bacteria travel towards their intestinal niche.  Once bacteria reach a suitable niche however, Aap must be removed for colonization to ensue.  This research, will determine the mechanism for Aap removal and thus how Hra1 and Aap work together to ensure that bacteria can bind and disperse in a manner that optimizes colonization of nematode intestines.  The project will also identify new surface factors involved in intestinal colonization and determine how, if at all, they interact with known surface proteins.  In addition to identifying proteins involved in binding among identical bacteria, the project will focus on uncovering surface proteins that allow different species of bacteria to interact with one another, as a first step to understanding community organization among the many types of bacteria living within a single multi-cellular organism.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>Bacteria are the most abundant life-forms on earth and colonize a wide variety of living and non-living niches by mechanisms that are not very well understood.

Creation of complex self-assembled circuits requires an easily programmable and sophisticated recognition capability; this can be provided by DNA.  For electronic devices, the DNA must conduct charge.  However, for distances longer than 50 nm, the conductivity of DNA is poor, especially in the dry state.  In this work, methods for increasing the conductivity of DNA will be explored and characterized.  The specific objectives of this work are:  (1) Investigate methods of imparting long-range conductivity or photoconductivity to DNA by forming DNA/chromophore hybrids of two types, one with porphyrins intercalated into the base stack and one using modified bases that absorb in the near UV.  (2) Refine techniques for selectively attaching the DNA/chromophore hybrids to specific electrodes, a requirement for the development of complex circuits.  (3) Test predictions of a model for the photoelectronic properties of porphyrin-containing self-assembled nanowires, using 4-probe measurements, measurements under ultrahigh vacuum and variable O2 concentration, and measurements using circularly-polarized light.  (4) Develop methods of creating three-terminal junctions in the DNA-chromophore hybrids, and also test for cross-talk between crossing hybrid strands.  The work also focuses on nanowires self-assembled solely from porphryin molecules.  These may have applications in molecular electronics, including light harvesting.  Furthermore, probing the porphryin nanowires can give important insights about fundamental mechanisms in the DNA/chromophore hybrids.  <br/><br/>Non-Technical:  The results of this work will help to lay the foundations for an eventual true revolution in self-assembled molecular electronics.  This field is at the stage where a deeper understanding of the basic science is needed to make progress.  This work will provide pioneering insights into the physics of conductivity (as opposed to transfer of single charges) in DNA-chromophore hybrids.  This research will include the first measurements of the effects of circularly polarized light on the photoelectronic properties of a self-assembled nanofilament.  Results from this work will motivate researchers in physics, physical chemistry, and biophysics.  Fifteen undergraduates and three high-school students will get an intense, cutting-edge research experience, including training in careful scientific practice as well as subfield-specific training.

The PI will use his experience from mentoring 79 undergraduate research students to create a website/wiki devoted to mentoring physics undergraduate researchers, with sections devoted to each subdiscipline of physics.  The PI will host the condensed matter portion of the website, will recruit other faculty to host the other sections, and will publicize the site by methods including annual contacts with all coordinators of physics 'Research Experience for Undergraduates' programs.  This website will be consulted by many research mentors each year, and will provide at least a 10% improvement in the research efficiency of their students, corresponding to thousands of work hours for all the students put together in a single year.

They can recognize cells that have been infected and initiate powerful immune responses against these cells as well as against the pathogen responsible for infection.  Immature T lymphocytes (also known as thymocytes) have to be ""trained"" to distinguish uninfected from infected cells.  This research team has developed an elaborate system to select young T lymphocytes that have potential to make this distinction from among the millions that are generated daily.   This selection process occurs in a specialized organ called the thymus and is a critical step in keeping us safe from autoimmune reactions.<br/><br/>In order to mature successfully, thymocytes must interact extensively with specialized cells known as thymic epithelial cells.  These interactions determine which immature T cells can safely enter circulation.  This project examines the interesting possibility that mature T lymphocytes, themselves, play a role in shaping these all-important interactions. Using genetically modified mouse strains and a set of imaging tools that can be used to identify and trace cells in the thymus, these investigators will test an original hypothesis that a special group of fully mature T lymphocytes stay in the thymus and enhance the ability of epithelial cells to select the most useful and least dangerous immature T lymphocytes for further maturation.  By improving our understanding of the molecular and cellular participants in T cell selection, these studies will shed light on what can go awry and contribute to autoimmune disease.<br/><br/>This investigation will also contribute directly and significantly to the training of young scientists.  The studies described will be performed exclusively by undergraduates, who were also the inspiration for the project.

This challenge of combining correctness and efficient hardware use is particularly difficult in scientific research, which often requires novel computing hardware for complex calculations. Different software ""tuning"" techniques are needed for shared-memory multi-core computers, distributed systems such as clusters of workstations, and high-speed graphics processors. Thus, scientific research with a computational element often requires great programming effort, which must be done with care, as performance tuning can introduce errors into a working program. The traditional alternative to manual performance tuning is the use of an automatic optimizing compiler. Such systems have largely replaced human beings for many tuning steps for single-core microprocessors (such as instruction selection and register allocation). More recently, research compilers such as Pluto have shown significant success in organizing the sharing of work within multi-core processors. Programmers using these systems are spared the work of tuning, but lose the ability to explore approaches that were not foreseen or chosen by the designer of the compiler. The AlphaZ system puts the mathematical foundation of the Pluto compiler (the ""polyhedral framework"") under control of the programmer, allowing manual tuning without needless effort or error. Like Pluto, AlphaZ can tune software for single- or multi-core systems. Pluto and AlphaZ are each the subject of ongoing research to support distributed computing by automatically transforming programs to distribute work across a cluster of computers with the MPI library. However, neither research project allows the programmer to explore novel ways to organize the motion of data among the constituent computers of a cluster.<br/>This RUI project is exploring extensions to the AlphaZ system to allow programmer-directed data transfer with MPI focusing both on the high-level design of these extensions and on anticipating implementation challenges. The envisioned extensions to AlphaZ will facilitate exploration, by both compiler writers and programmers, of strategies for moving data in a distributed computing environment. Furthermore, these extensions will validate a program tuning strategy that could be applied to other new architectures such as graphics processors."

Quantum mechanics underpins every fundamental physical science. Computation has made a profound impact on almost every area of life, and science is no exception, with computer simulation extending our understanding in fields ranging from from fluid mechanics to genomics. However, when we apply computation to the study of quantum systems we face fundamental limitations arising from the difference between classical and quantum physics. Quantum mechanics presents serious conceptual challenges, displacing basic classical notions of physical reality such as the deterministic trajectories of Newtonian motion. This means that exact computer simulation of quantum systems often requires tracking many possible outcomes simultaneously, requiring resources which grow rapidly with the size of the system. However, this also implies that computers which operate according to quantum mechanics should have different capabilities than existing classical computers - in particular, they should allow effcient simulation of quantum systems. Simulation of other quantum systems is therefore one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. The number of quantum bits (qubits) required to implement these algorithms is in the few hundreds even for applications beyond the reach of classical computation. The work funded in this proposal will provide a theoretical roadmap of detailed experiments leading us from the few qubit quantum computers of today to the applications on few tens to few hundreds of qubits which can compete with current calculations of scientific interest. We focus on applications of relevance to chemistry, specifically the calculation of molecular energies and simulation of chemical reactions.<br/><br/>The development of even a medium scale quantum computer for quantum simulation would be a technological feat of considerable importance. The work performed in this project will bring this goal closer. Many aspects of this work will be disseminated in the form of a numerical toolkit for quantum simulation, placing the ability to easily design experiments in quantum simulation in the hands of experimental groups. The focus on quantum simulation applied to quantum chemistry means that such experiments will be guided towards the development of devices capable of performing quantum simulations with broad impact in many areas of physical science. The grant will support postdoctoral scholars and undergraduate students at Haverford college and so enhance the research environment for undergraduate students at Haverford college. The educational experience of students outside the physical sciences at Haverford College will be enhanced through the development of a new course for non-majors on foundational questions in quantum mechanics. The impact of this work will also extend beyond the student community through a set of public lectures connected to this new course."

Visitation, imaging, and sampling in the very near future at a subset of these sites will provide timely information on any acute impacts on benthic fauna, as well as provide ground-truthing of data suggesting that the oil/dispersant mixture is spreading along density gradients at depth.<br/>We propose to revisit sites where we have ongoing studies, including pre-exposure tissue and live coral samples, and well-marked and navigated mosaics of coral and coral/tubeworm communities.

The lack of success with static parallelization is due in part to the inability of classic parallelization techniques to expose sufficient memory locality.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to develop compiler techniques that will allow dense matrix problems to run efficiently on clusters of workstations by dramatically increasing locality while respecting the parallelism constraints of the code. The PI plans to  investigate techniques for automatically producing high performance for dense matrix codes executing on clusters of workstations by ""tiling"" time-skewed loop nests such that they can execute efficiently on a cluster of multicore workstations. This research will enable automatic program optimization for numerical applications. The proposed activity could advance the state of performance models for tiling for clusters."

Approaching<br/>symplectic and contact geometry through a topological lens has<br/>given rise to a young and thriving discipline with interesting<br/>questions that explore the boundary between flexibility (when the<br/>symplectic world behaves topologically) and rigidity (when the<br/>symplectic world behaves geometrically).  In particular, the PIs<br/>plan to study the Arnold Conjecture for Legendrian submanifolds,<br/>squeezing phenomena for Lagrangian disks, and the cobordism<br/>theory of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Special attention will be<br/>paid to Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds and Lagrangian<br/>surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds. The methods used in<br/>addressing the aforementioned problems are of interest in their<br/>own right.  On one hand, the PIs plan to develop and use<br/>pseudo-holomorphic techniques initiated by Gromov and Floer, and<br/>expanded to the Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) framework by<br/>Eliashberg, Givental, and Hofer. On the other, the PIs plan to<br/>develop and use generating family techniques.  Investigations<br/>into the structure of the holomorphic and the generating family<br/>based invariants will yield insight into geometric flexibility<br/>and rigidity; making connections between these different types of<br/>invariants will increase understanding of each.<br/><br/>Symplectic and contact topology have their roots in physics as<br/>the language of classical mechanics and geometric optics.  While<br/>remaining in touch with those roots, symplectic and contact<br/>topology have blossomed into a central mathematical field that<br/>combines features of geometry (the science of measurement) and<br/>topology (the study of the shape of space).  This field has a<br/>variety of applications including fluid mechanics, differential<br/>equations, and the study of the possible shape of the<br/>3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time in which we<br/>live. The goal of the PIs' project is to achieve a better<br/>understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between<br/>geometry and topology, and thereby strengthening the foundation<br/>for the aforementioned applications.  The PIs'research activities<br/>will bring a diverse set of students at both the undergraduate<br/>and graduate levels into the process of discovering new<br/>mathematics, with the PIs' research with undergraduates serving<br/>as a pedagogical laboratory for integrating mathematical research<br/>into the PIs' curricula."

ETA cells will be economically competitive with fossil fuels at their predicted efficiencies of 15% because they can be produced by low-cost solution methods. However, demonstrated ETA cell efficiencies are only 2.5%. The discrepancy between realized and predicted efficiency is due to lack of fundamental understanding of the role of interfaces and material properties on charge transfer processes within the cell. ETA cells employ a mesoporous n-type semiconductor coated at the interface with a thin absorber film, with pores filled by a p-type semiconductor to create an interpenetrating heterojunction. The operating principle of the ETA cell is that the large junction area presented by an n-type nanowire array allows thin absorber layers to be used, such that charge separation across the interfaces is faster than competing bulk recombination. Nanowires are also the ideal geometry to quickly transport the separated charges to opposite contacts before they can undergo interfacial recombination. To date, ETA cells have primarily been studied by making solar cells and measuring their I-V characteristics, with few fundamental studies of either the individual materials and interfaces or charge transport within the cell. The proposed approach will use a combination of spectroscopy and electron microscopy of individual materials and interfaces as well as steady-state and perturbation studies of ETA solar cells to gain fundamental insight into charge transfer mechanisms in the ZnO-nanowire/CdSe/CuSCN materials system. Techniques including impedance spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy will be employed to (1) measure carrier lifetime and mobility in individual materials and thin film stacks, (2) measure characteristic times to compare charge separation vs bulk recombination and charge transport vs. interfacial recombination, (3) determine processes that limit cell performance, and (4) design interfaces and material properties to improve charge transfer and, hence, increase ETA cell efficiency. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The transformational, spectroscopy-driven approach described in this proposal will be applied to ETA cells for the first time in order to understand the bulk and interfacial phenomena that govern cell performance. This work will explore the nature of charge transfer across nano-structured semiconductor interfaces, specifically focusing on the role of architecture, defect structure, and electronic band structure. Solution methods of depositing extremely thin coatings of high quality and precise thickness will be developed. Ex situ characterization of materials and interfaces will be combined with measurements of ETA cells to identify the properties or processes that limit cell efficiencies. This detailed understanding, which cannot be achieved using conventional methods, will allow comparison of experimental observations with theoretical predictions and will aid in the design of materials, interfaces, and molecular architectures that enable higher energy conversion efficiencies. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: If successful, the proposed renewable energy related work will provide the fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena that is necessary to increase efficiencies of solar cells from 2.5% toward the 15% predicted by theory. Such an improvement could potentially transform ETA cell technology to be economically competitive with fossil fuels. Low-cost ETA cells would provide a source of clean, secure, sustainable energy that could shift the U.S. portfolio away from fossil fuels and toward energy independence. The design principles learned from the CdSe system can be applied to other absorbers such as CuInGaSe2 for even higher potential efficiency. Additionally, the enhanced understanding of charge transfer at nano-structured semiconductor heterojunctions will be useful for many other nano-structured systems where controlling interfaces is critical to achieving high performance. These applications include organic-inorganic solar cells, displays, electrochromics, and batteries, all of which are important for sustainable energy or energy efficiency. The novel experimental approach described in this proposal can be employed by other researchers to enable new advances in a broad range science and technology fields. <br/><br/>The educational objectives of this proposal are to educate students through research activities and curriculum development and to expose people of diverse ages and backgrounds to general concepts in renewable energy. A ""Solar Energy Seminar Series"" will be established to engage the general Drexel community; and an ""Energy and Sustainability Workshop"" for 5th-6th grade students and their teachers will be initiated in partnership with the School District of Philadelphia. This workshop will naturally be directed toward underrepresented groups since the district is over 80% African-American and Hispanic and will involve 100 students and 25 teachers over 5 years.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Interfacial Processes and Thermodynamics program and the Sustainable Energy program in the NSF CBET Division."

The liberal arts environment is a rich training ground for the nation?s future leaders in science and medicine, and the opportunities made possible by this project will expose students at all levels to the research process. These effects will be magnified by outreach activities involving secondary school students and their teachers through both off-campus talks and on-campus workshops, and will enhance the research-rich environment at the College through support of this interdisciplinary project. Between 4-6 students per year will be involved in accomplishing the objectives of this proposal. The research team will include both underclass students and seniors in the process of doing science over the summer and during academic terms.

This aberrant process, resulting in the formation of large fibrils, is a general molecular problem common to all organisms and can lead to metabolic and structural deficiencies.  Recently, the process of this aggregation has come under scrutiny since the intermediates formed during fibril growth can themselves persist in the organism and interfere with normal cellular processes.  Stretches of glutamine repeats fold into a b-sheet structure, which then acts as a template for aggregation by the further addition of polypeptide strands to form a long filament.  Individual filaments can further associate to form multi-filament fibrils.  The glutamines are thought to stabilize these structures through mechanisms involving hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, although the details of these interactions and their respective roles during the self-assembly process are still controversial.  The PI has developed a peptide model system that can form a prototypical b-sheet, called a b-hairpin, that can be studied using a variety of biophysical methods to probe the role of the glutamines in fostering b-sheet, filament, and fibril formation.  Three specific goals are:  (1) finding conditions to stabilize intermediates in the fibril assembly pathway so that the role of glutamine interactions on growth and stability can be assessed; (2) measuring the effects of amino acid mutations on these processes to probe chemical mechanism; and (3) isotope-labeling of specific glutamines to probe directly for stable hydrogen bonding in the various intermediates.  The outcome of these studies will help to understand a fundamental problem in protein misfolding and to test a variety of structural models that have been proposed for proteins containing poly-glutamine repeats.<br/><br/>This research has been developed as a set of projects suitable for undergraduates since the primary research efforts will be undertaken by students working to complete their thesis requirements in biology.  Students engaged in this work will gain training in interdisciplinary research.  This necessitates collaborative work and students will be working closely with colleagues in the Chemistry Department and collaborators at the University of Pennsylvania.  Work on this project has led to the creation of lectures in protein folding and misfolding for an introductory course, more advanced lectures for an upper-level course in protein structure and function, and the development of a 7-week primary-literature-based course on protein misfolding and aggregation.  The PI has a long-standing commitment to improving access to research for under-represented groups.  In addition to a long-term commitment to an existing outreach program for science and writing for K-12 students from Philadelphia, he has regularly reserved space in his research lab over the summer and during the academic year for at least one student self-identified as belonging to an under-represented group.  More broadly, as the director of the HHMI-sponsored programs at Haverford College, the PI is responsible for awarding student interdisciplinary research fellowships and funding internal and external research opportunities for students belonging to under-represented groups, administering several outreach programs, and supporting faculty development seminars and workshops to enhance the overall research program in the sciences.<br/><br/>"

This Phase I research aims to demonstrate the feasibility of: 1) using the technique to develop commercially-viable ACTS for well-defined STEM content; and 2) to extend the technique to support ACTS that will enable learners to solve novel problems that they have not been taught how to solve; and 3) to deliver such content over the web. <br/><br/>Full realization of this innovation will increase the impact of ACTS in STEM education by increasing learning efficiency, reducing development costs, improving quality control and yielding systems that can easily be configured to meet specific educational needs. If successful, this project will result in ACTS having direct application in schools as well as open new opportunities in the commercial world. The application will cut development cost in half, making it commercially feasible to develop even specialized and highly efficient ACTS, while maintaining quality control, and has the potential of radically improving the way adaptive tutorial systems are built as well as the effectiveness of those systems."

Additionally, he proposes new observational schemes to test these models. The PI's long-term research plans over the next five years focus on two themes. One is at the Interface of Particle Physics and Cosmology where he hopes to look at the consequences for LHC physics of his new model that unifies gravity with the electroweak force.  He will also investigate the phenomenological consequences of a Supersymmetric extension of this model.   The second area concerns the nature of the cosmological singularity.

However, in some cases this assumption may fail, casting doubt on the reliability of such measurements.  Hence, it is important to achieve a better understanding of the motion of particles in fluid flows.  The project, at a predominately undergraduate institution, will focus on the role of the inertia of particles in causing deviations from ideal particle motion, and potentially provides a way to improve fluid dynamical measurement methods.  In related work, the project will use tracked particles to investigate the transition from regular fluid flow to the state of chaotic flow, where the flow becomes unpredictable.  Such flows are widespread, and test our understanding of complex states.  The novel method to be employed in the project involves the characterization of complex flow patterns by locating unique features of the flow pattern, such as the centers of local rotation, or vortices.  The experiments will be conducted by pairing a postdoctoral trainee with undergraduate students.  This approach provides important training advantages for both. <br/><br/>****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****<br/>The motion of particles in fluids is important both as a fundamental topic in materials science, and because it provides a powerful diagnostic method of studying fluid flow.  This project at a predominately undergraduate institution, will explore the theme of particle dynamics in fluids by means of small-scale well-controlled laboratory experiments.  The motion of particles of varying sizes in flows at modest Reynolds number is investigated, to understand how the particles? behavior changes as their inertia increases.  An important result will be to understand the conditions under which transported particles can serve as passive flow tracers, as is assumed for nearly every modern flow measurement technique.  The behavior of a floating sheared layer of particles will be studied to gain insight into the deformation of soft materials, and particles flowing in a micro-channel will allow study of the transition to irreversible flow.  Finally, the project will investigate the transition to space-time chaos by determining the curvature of particle trajectories. This novel method allows the special topological features of a complex fluid flow to be determined, and to be tracked over time as the flow makes a transition from regular flow to the state of space-time chaos.  The pairing of a postdoctoral trainee with undergraduate students in this research provides important training advantages for both.  <br/>"

Fortunately, organisms have devised a way to avoid autoimmunity, by 'testing' immature T cells (thymocytes) for self-reactivity as they mature in the protected environment of the thymus. If the T cell receptors expressed by an immature thymocyte engage self-antigens encountered in the thymus with high avidity, the TCRs will generate signals that kill the cell. A proportion of cells that pass this test mature into CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive T cells that populate the lymph nodes and spleen (the 'periphery').  Once in the periphery, T cells respond very differently to strong T cell receptor engagement. Instead of dying, they proliferate and differentiate into helper and killer lymphocytes. It is still a mystery how immature thymocytes and their immediate descendants, mature T cells, respond so differently to the identical TCR signal. Published findings funded by a previous NSF-RUI grant revealed a provocative distinction between the signaling cascades initiated by T cell receptors in immature and mature T cells. Whereas both cell populations respond to TCR stimulation by upregulating the expression of Nur77 - a transcription factor known to induce cell death - only mature T cells heavily phosphorylate Nur77, an event that banishes Nur77 to the cytosol of a cell. The investigators have also shown that the failure of immature T cells to phosphorylate Nur77 in response to TCR signals is in part due to their failure to activate (phosphorylate) a key upstream regulator of cell survival, Akt.  The goal of the project is to move closer to the origin of the differences in TCR signaling between immature and mature T cells.  The PI describes an unexpected finding, that immature T cells fail to phosphorylate Akt not because of a problem with the activity of upstream kinases, but because of an enhancement in the activity of an upstream phosphatase.  The project will explore a novel hypothesis, that this phosphatase activity and holoenzyme composition differ between immature and mature T cells, and that these differences are the basis for the distinct response of immature and mature T cells to TCR stimulation. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The work will be performed entirely by undergraduates at Haverford College, and the experiments that led to the hypothesis were motivated directly by their original pursuits. The NSF RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) funding not only allows students to be exposed to the most current research performed in the immunological discipline, but also permits them to be direct contributors to it.  Funding of this project directly supports the efforts of senior Biology majors, all of whom are expected to perform an original research project.  It will also support the development of younger students (many of whom are in Haverford's Multicultural Scholar Program) who join the lab in the summer or as work-study students during the academic year. All students are exposed to an educational approach that asks them to raise a question of importance, test a hypothesis experimentally, and rigorously critique data. NSF funds allow the students to engage in bench research at a sophisticated level and enhances the expectations that students and faculty have of each other as they collaborate in an effort that inspires the development a serious intellectual commitment, a willingness to engage literature, critique evidence, and the courage to speculate. Funds also permit students to follow their experimental 'noses' and wander off narrow trajectories to test an original thought. Some students produce publishable data and participate in writing papers, most will present their work at national and local scientific meetings, and some will discover something novel that will inspire the next grant and the next 'generation' of students. And those who may not pursue research as a career will still have experienced what it is like to be a participant rather than an observer in the generation of knowledge - and will leave with a more developed sense of responsibility for the quality of information that they will one day shape and share."

This project seeks to develop an understanding of the basic science governing DSA of functional monomers, and the photonic and electronic properties of the resulting structures. The research plan is based on close interplay between molecular modeling and design, synthesis of building blocks and scaffolds, spectroscopic characterization of self-assembly under varying conditions, and structural and physical characterization of the resulting assemblies using a variety of scanned probe and electron microscopies, and electrical measurements under controlled illumination and temperature. The focus of these studies will be materials made from the assembly of porphyrins into one-dimensional structures. Related to the chlorophylls found in photosynthetic organisms, porphyrins can form structures that are photophysically and photochemically active. Studies will focus on the self-organization of porphyrins, and their self-assembly with the aid of peptide scaffolds to give control over the geometry and photoelectronic properties of the final assemblies. The underlying mechanisms of the photoelectronic properties will also be explored, to evaluate possible use of the building blocks for devices, such as conducting nanowires, solar cells, and chemical sensors.<br/><br/>With this RUI award, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program are supporting the research of Professors Karin S. Akerfeldt, Robert Fairman, and Walter Fox Smith, of the Departments of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics (respectively) at Haverford College. This collaborative team is studying the phenomenon of molecular self-assembly, by which smaller molecules spontaneously assemble into structurally-defined aggregates. Mastery of the rules for designing molecular assemblies, by controlling the structure and chemical properties of the basic building blocks, would permit the creation of nanometer- to micron-size assemblies with desired shapes, reactivity, and photonic or electronic properties. Such control would represent a powerful approach to the design and manufacture of devices big and small, with atomic-scale precision in the relative placement of components. Postdoctoral fellows will be given the opportunity to co-teach courses with experienced faculty at Haverford, providing excellent training for careers that involve teaching and research. Aspects of the collaborative research efforts will be exported to workshops for high school teachers, and high school students will be hosted for six-week summer research experiences."

Early in meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair, exchange, and synapse along their length. Both the number and the location of exchanges are highly regulated, a phenomenon known as crossover control. Crossover control is thought to be related to changes in chromosome structure, but this has not been proved. The mechanism of pairing itself, the process by which one chromosome finds its homologous partner, is also not understood. This research will address both of these issues in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. <br/><br/>Mutations in the gene him-5 affect crossover control, most strongly on the X chromosome but also on the other chromosomes. HIM-5 is a germline-specific chromosomal protein that interacts with twelve other proteins, all of them either chromosomal proteins or expressed in  the germline. The functions and localization of these twelve proteins will be investigated in both wild-type and him-5 mutant animals. In addition, suppressors of him-5 will be identified genetically and compared to the protein interactions. Suppressors will include a broader class of genes that those involved in the protein interactions, and these genes will also be mapped, cloned, and analyzed. <br/><br/>Mutations in the gene him-8 in C. elegans specifically abolish pairing of the X chromosome with no effect on other chromosomes. The HIM-8 protein mediates pairing by binding to specific sequences at the pairing center on the X chromosome. Proteins related to HIM-8 have been shown to mediate paring of each of the autosomes, also by binding to specific pairing centers on these chromosomes. It is postulated that HIM-8 and these other proteins work as the targeting subunit of a larger protein complex that bring chromosomes together. Proteins that interact with HIM-8 and its relatives will be found by testing nearly every protein in the worm genome with the yeast two-hybrid assay. Interacting genes identified in this assay are already cloned, and information about their structure, expression, and possible function is available from genomic resources. The network of protein interactions will be connected to the existing broader network of protein interactions being done in C. elegans to find potentially all of the proteins that affect meiotic chromosome pairing. Several of these interacting proteins will be pursued further to analyze their effect on meiotic chromosome behavior. Mutational analysis of the him-8 gene will be used to determine functional domains of the protein and its interacting partners.<br/><br/>All of these experiments will be done by undergraduate students working with the principal investigator. Because meiosis is a fundamental process whose main characteristics have been known for decades, most students are familiar with its basic properties.

The role of early sensory input in guiding the development of sensory pathways is well known for some sensory modalities (i.e., vision), but not as well understood for the various submodalities of somatosensation (the body senses: touch, itch, vibration, tickle, pain).   This project uses the newborn mouse as a model organism, since it is born in a highly immature state (the equivalent of a 15 week gestational human).  Applying sensory stimulation to such an immature system will illuminate the processes by which external stimuli affect the developing nervous system.  It is expected that since the developing nervous system is highly malleable, then sensory input during this stage will have long-term, maybe even permanent effects.  Subjects will be exposed to a noxious stimulus during the neonatal period (within hours to days following birth).  In adulthood, these same animals will be tested on a variety of measures to determine how sensory pathways form in response to the neonatal stimulus.   Following re-exposure to a noxious stimulus, brain tissue will be examined for presence of cFos-a marker of neural activity.  Blood levels of hormones involved in the stress response will be assessed, and behavioral responses to re-exposure to the stimulus will also be measured.  This project also aims to identify the underlying genetic mediators of sensory-induced alterations.  Thus, the undergraduate students who are involved in all portions of the project will be exposed to a wide range of neuroscientific techniques, from genes to cells to behavior.

The strong interplay between orientational order, which is easily influenced by external fields, and elastic distortion makes these materials candidates for a variety of interesting applications from artificial muscles to actuators to stress tunable lasers.  The ideal nematic elastomer is a uniaxial rubber that forms via a symmetry-breaking phase transition from an isotropic rubber.  It is characterized by soft elasticity in which one of the five elastic constants of an uniaxial solid vanishes.  Laboratory monodomain nematic elastomers are not formed in a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking; they typically are prepared so that nematic order is locked in at the time of crosslinking.  These systems exhibit semi-soft elasticity in which stress-strain relations at small strain are characterized by the five elastic constants of a uniaxial solid but become more like those of soft elasticity at larger strains.  The first major goal of this research is to improve our understanding of semi-soft elasticity through investigations of models with an interplay between local bond directions and nematic order and to develop theories for smectic-C elastomers, the ideal form of which exhibit spontaneous broken symmetry and an associated soft elasticity in the plane of the smectic layers.<br/><br/>Rattlebacks are elongated objects that have a preferred direction of spin on a flat surface.

New T cells are produced every day in an organ called the thymus, and every new T cell produced expresses a novel T cell receptor. Because these novel T cell receptors cannot intrinsically discriminate between proteins made by an invading pathogen and proteins made by the body's own cells, autoimmunity is a constant threat for an organism.  However, the body has ways to destroy autoreactive T cells as they browse the thymus during their development in the thymus. Specifically, if an immature T cell binds strongly to any thymic peptide it encounters, its T cell receptor will generate signals that induce the cell to die.  An immature T cell that does not bind to a self-peptide strongly is permitted to mature into a functional T cell and exit from the thymus.  At this point a mature T cell responds to strong T cell receptor signals not by dying, but by dividing and initiating an immune response. The molecular switch(es) responsible for this marked change in interpretation of a strong T cell receptor signal between an immature and mature T cell are not known, yet are the basis for our understanding of how organisms protect themselves against autoimmunity. This project is designed to improve our understanding of the differences in response to T cell receptor stimulation and builds upon findings that a protein that regulates cell death, known as Nur77, is treated differently in mature versus immature T cells.  Whereas both cell types respond to T cell receptor signals by increasing production of Nur77, only the mature T cells respond additionally by altering the protein through the attachment of phosphate molecules (phosphorylation).  Investigators will determine what internal signals are responsible for these alterations and how and why they differ between the two cells.  They will also work to understand the impact of phosphorylation on the function of Nur77 and have specifically hypothesized that the changes disable Nur77, preventing it from turning on a set of genes that coordinate the cell death program.  This work will clarify our understanding of how a T cell population that is screened against responsiveness to 'self' proteins develops the ability to respond to pathogens it encounters outside the thymus. The PI has a strong mentoring program in undergraduate laboratory research. Her students co-author papers and present their findings at meetings.      <br/><br/>"

Using a combination of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, careful analysis of experimental studies and state-of-the-art total energy calculations for diffusion barriers, the principal investigator (PI) has recently demonstrated that the structure and development of surface alloys grown via heteroepitaxial deposition can be fully accounted for.  Such systems, involving as they do here more than one atomic species and mixing of the deposited species several layers into the substrate, are challenging to model accurately and so the success achieved is noteworthy.  There are also strong technological motivations for extending this work to other bi-metallic systems since several of them have important relevance for surface magnetism and catalysis.  The model developed for treating the surface kinetics of such systems at the atomic level is based on a simple, coordination dependent, parametrized approximation for the energy barriers governing local atomic arrangements.  Both direct moves and exchange (coordinated, two-atom) moves are included.  The necessary parameters are deduced from experimental information combined with total energy calculations using the VASP protocol and the nudged elastic band method of mapping out diffusion pathways and barriers.  The kinetic development and evolution of the surface alloy system based on these moves and the associated barriers are determined via a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (BLK algorithm), which also treats the deposition process faithfully.  This approach has succeeded in fully accounting for the interesting coverage dependent structures seen for the Rh/Ag(001) system, and a first report on this work has recently appeared in the journal Surface Science.<br/><br/>In the present research this treatment and model will be extended to other regimes and systems in collaboration with the experimental group of R.

The first extension will be to the Rh/Ag(001) system at higher temperature and then to other soft-metal substrate surface alloys of differing substrate symmetry.  After that we will extend the method to harder substrate cases of industrial significance.  Such systems should evolve similarly, but require higher temperatures to achieve the necessary mobility.  In making these extensions to the model we will also test for the necessity of extensions to our model for the coordination dependence of the activation energy barriers.<br/><br/>The group also has underway a detailed analysis of adatoms and vacancies on metallic terraces.

During development, cells which express potentially auto-immune or functionally irrelevant receptors are excised before they reach maturity.  In addition, once a lymphocyte has participated in an antigen-specific response, it may be eliminated either passively, following growth factor withdrawal, or actively, after interaction with cells bearing death-inducing signals.  In this project, the role of the IAP (Inhibitors of APoptosis) family of anti-apoptotic proteins will be explored in normal lymphocytes.  IAPs share a unique, 70 amino acid BIR (Baculovirus Inhibitor of apoptosis Repeat) domain and most function by inhibiting some of the caspase enzymes which play a central role in apoptosis.  Mouse- (m)-survivin, the central focus of this work, is the smallest and simplest of these interesting IAP proteins.  The thesis to be investigated is that different anti-apoptotic molecules may function at particular stages in the lymphocyte life-cycle.  In particular, it is posited that survivin acts to preserve lymphocyte viability in cells which are undergoing rapid proliferation and/or are subject to active selective pressure. The signals and conditions which induce m-survivin expression in B and T lymphocytes, both in vivo and in vitro will be investigated and the relative kinetics of IAP expression will be compared with those of other anti-apoptotic proteins.  The lymphocyte subpopulations in which m-survivin is expressed will be defined, and the experiments will also explore the effects of over-expression of survivin on the capacity of lymphocytes to withstand induction of cell death. Finally, a novel modification of mRNA differential display methodology, first developed by the PI's laboratory will be employed to characterize the expression of multiple members of the BIR-containing family in differentiating lymphocytes.  <br/><br/>This research will be conducted at an undergraduate institution.

Three-pronged approach will be used to accomplish the goal.  First, synthetic genes that encode copolymers of 14-amino acid blocks will be constructed, whose sequences are based on de novo, minimalist-design principles.  These genes will be cloned into expression vectors to make dimeric coiled coils that range from 70 residues to greater than 1,000 residues per helix.  Specifically, this system will be used to test the role of intermediates in the assembly of long coiled coils, such as monomeric helix formation and nucleation of specific helix pairing interactions to dictate proper phasing of helices.  After expressing and purifying these designed proteins, their structures will be characterized using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, and single molecule techniques such as atomic force microscopy and laser tweezing.  Second, to complement these design studies, a myosin coiled-coil rod domain will be used as a model system for folding studies involving segment swapping between designed and natural sequences.  In addition, the myosin coiled coil will be used to help develop biophysical protocols for studying designed coiled coils, using the instruments described above.  Finally, these synthetic peptide blocks will be used to make long copolymers for the study of other coiled coil topologies and higher order assembly to form fibrils.  Long copolymers are generated by forming staggered helical structures that act as templates for their own head-to-tail self-assembly.  Peptides will be synthesized and purified in the laboratory and then characterized using the same biophysical techniques described above.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to understand the basic relationship between protein sequence and structure.  It is still not possible to predict protein structure and function from first principles, mainly because it is still not understood how proteins balance the major chemical forces in attaining their three dimensional shape.  Two approaches have been applied to study this problem, defining the fields of protein folding and design.  The two questions are the inverse of one another: scientists in the field of protein folding ask, ""Can we predict the structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence?"" and those who work on protein design ask, ""Can we predict what sequence of a protein will result in a target structure?""   Both of these strategies will be used in the study of coiled coils.  These structural motifs, predicted to be in 1/3 of all proteins, involve the interaction between two or more alpha-helices.  The modular design of the experiments will allow students to make significant achievements over the course of a summer experience and an academic year working towards a senior thesis project.  This cohesive program in design, along with a strong modular component, should provide a rewarding experience for students interested generally in interdisciplinary sciences, including elements of biochemistry and biophysics.<br/>"

Both the number and the location of exchange events are highly regulated in a poorly understood process called crossover control. Crossover control is postulated to be closely related to chromosome compaction, although direct proof of this postulate has been lacking. Mutations that alter the number or the distribution of crossovers have been identified in many organisms, including C. elegans.  Recessive mutations in the autosomal gene him-5 reduce the number of crossovers on the X chromosome and alter the distribution of the residual crossovers.  Preliminary molecular evidence indicates that the predicted HIM-5 protein has a region of homology to RCC1, a well-known protein involved in chromosome compaction in vertebrates.  Direct proof that this gene corresponds to him-5 will be obtained by determining the structure of transcripts from the locus and sequencing these in him-5 mutants.  The expression pattern of the gene will be determined in both sexes, and in various mutant strains affecting meiosis and germ-line development. Using immunofluorescence, the location of the HIM-5 protein in the gonad will be determined in order to infer the meiotic processes affected.  A closer homologue of RCC1 has also been shown to affect meiosis in C. elegans, but the gene involved has not been studied.  Mutations of this gene will be identified and characterized genetically and cytologically.  The expression of this gene will be studied as well.  Epistatic relationships between this gene and him-5, as well as other meiotic mutants, will be used to clarify the functional relationships among the genes.  As RCC1 is well-known in other organisms, the characterization of its role in meiosis in C. elegans could make a direct connection between chromosome structure and crossover control. One familiar genetic manifestation of crossover control is the phenomenon of interference, whereby one crossover prevents the occurrence of a second crossover nearby.  Previous work has shown there is extremely high interference in C. elegans, and that most chromosomes have exactly one exchange.  Interestingly, all of the known double crossover exceptions had one of the crossovers in a region of the X chromosome known to have other unusual meiotic properties.  Genetic mapping experiments, combined with analysis from the genomic sequence, will be used to examine the unusual meiotic properties in this region and to ask if these have a common basis.<br/>Undergraduate students under the direction of the principal investigator will conduct all of these experiments. Because meiosis is a fundamental process whose main characteristics have been known for decades, most students are familiar with the basic properties.  However, the molecular basis for crossover control is quite obscure.  Therefore, the students will be carrying out significant research on a fundamental and familiar process.<br/><br/>"

The transition of cells from the DP to the SP stage is governed by signals generated by interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC/antigen complexes encountered in the thymus. Depending on the affinity of the interactions, and involvement of select co-stimulatory molecules, DP cells will either mature or undergo cell death (apoptosis). In particular, high affinity signals mediated by the TCR induce the death of immature DP thymocytes. However, once they mature to the SP T cell stage, they respond quite differently to high affinity TCR stimulation. Instead of inducing apoptosis, SP T cells are induced to proliferate. This project reflects an interest in the molecular basis for this difference in response to TCR signals between precursors and product cell populations.<br/> <br/><br/>During the previous NSF funding period, a marked cellular difference in the response of immature and mature T cells to TCR signals was demonstrated. The investigators found that, unlike mature SP T cells, immature DP thymocytes failed to recruit lipid rafts to the site of TCR stimulation.  Lipid rafts are specialized subdomains in the lipid membrane that are enriched for a variety of critical signaling molecules and targets that can modulate quantitatively and qualitatively TCR signaling. The data further indicated that lipid raft recruitment required PI 3-kinase activity in mature SP T cells and led the investigators to advance a mechanistic model for raft recruitment. The investigators postulated that immature DP thymocytes failed to recruit lipid rafts because they failed to optimally activate the lipid kinase, PI-3 kinase, in response to TCR signals. Further, they suggested that the failure to recruit rafts increased the susceptibility of DP thymocytes to TCR- induced cell death by compromising the activation of a critical regulator of survival and proliferation, Akt/PKB. These hypotheses will be directly addressed by this research.<br/>"

These surveys will enable us to determine the nature and abundance of faint, high-redshift, radio sources and to determine the mechanism responsible for their radio emission.  The star formation history of the Universe may thus be calculated without the need to correct for dust extinction as in observing at optical wavelengths.

The production of new tubulin subunits begins with the translation of alpha and beta tubulin-encoding mRNAs, followed by folding of the nascent polypeptide chains and formation of alpha-beta dimers. The dimers then become part of the pool of free subunits available for microtubule assembly.  This translation and dimerization pathway involves special proteins called molecular chaperones that assist in the maturation of tubulin subunits.  A key participant is a large multimeric complex called CCT (for Chaperonin Containing TCP- 1).  CCT has been studied biochemically in a variety of cell types and genetically in yeast; however, relatively little is known about how the folding pathway is spatially organized within the complex environment of the cytoplasm, or how it may play a role in regulating microtubule assembly through dimer availability.<br/><br/>In this project, Dr. Johnson will perform experiments directed at localizing CCT and other components of the tubulin folding pathway in the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas.  Chlamydomonas is an important model organism for the study of a variety of significant cellular features, including flagellar motility.  Its pair of long, whip-like flagella extend from the apical cytoplasm of each cell and beat in wave-form, oar-like strokes to propel the cell though its aqueous environment.  Each flagellum is a complex miniature machine containing a bundle of specialized microtubules that are animated by also-specialized dynein molecular motors; this complex longitudinal array of microtubules and motors is termed an axoneme and is characteristic of flagella in general.   These flagella can be experimentally removed from the Chlamydomonas cells, and such removal results in the triggering of a flagellar regeneration process in which replacement structures, each as long as the cell body itself, are produced within 90 minutes.  This process, which can be conveniently induced in the laboratory, involves massive translation of new tubulin proteins within the cell body, movement of tubulin dimers into and through the flagellar space and polymerization of the dimers into nascent microtubules at the distal (far) end of the elongating structure.  It is within this context of spatially separated synthesis, transport and assembly that Dr. Johnson will investigate the organization of the tubulin folding pathway.  Using a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches, Dr. Johnson will characterize genes encoding Chlamydomonas CCT subunits and study their expression during flagellar regeneration. Specific antibody probes to the subunits will be used to localize CCT within the cell using immunofluorescence and immunoEM techniques. These experiments will be carried out in a predominantly undergraduate institution and will involve extensive participation by undergraduates in the research process.  <br/>This investigation offers significant opportunities for novel insight into the spatial<br/>organization of tubulin biogenesis in the living cell. Because microtubule architectures,<br/>and the processes that cells use to create them, are highly conserved in all eukaryotes,<br/>such studies will lead to a better understanding of microtubule biology in general. <br/>"

This instrument is an important tool in biochemistry for studying regular structure in proteins and nucleic acids and has been used extensively as a tool to help define how proteins fold.  This<br/>instrument is also used to study spectroscopic properties of other biomolecules, such as light-harvesting assemblies as described in this proposal.<br/><br/>	Research in Dr. Fairman's and Dr. Akerfeldt's laboratories focuses on the use of synthetic peptides as model systems to study important protein structures.  Dr. Fairman's research program involves a study of how amino acid sequences dictate the stability and specificity of protein structures.  His work uses the coiled coil structural motif, a simple protein structural motif involving interactions between alpha-helices, first described at the molecular level by Frances Crick and Linus Pauling in the early 1950's.  Information gained from these studies will be used to design self-assembling polymers towards the creation of new nanoengineering tools.  Dr. Akerfeldt's research tries to understand how protein domains cooperate to define functions in proteins.  Calbindin d28k is used as a model system to study the cooperative interactions of motifs designed to  bind and store calcium.  A reductionist approach is applied by synthesizing each individual structural motif, characterizing its structure and affinity for calcium, and then reconstructing the full activity of the protein by combining these synthetic peptides back together.  Dr. de Paula's research involves understanding the mechanism of aggregation of the light-harvesting molecules, porphyrin and chlorophyll.  These systems are promising nano-sized materials for light-harvesting applications.  Dr. White's research involves the study of protein-RNA interactions focusing on investigating the interaction between yeast ribosomal protein L30 and its RNA transcript, L30 RNA.  The existence of secondary structure in peptide fragments of the L30 proteins that retain RNA-binding ability will be examined.  CD will be used to study the RNA-protein complex for exploring conformational changes upon complex formation.<br/><br/>	In addition to the use of this instrument for specific research programs, the instrument will also play an important role in the training of students in both the Biology and Chemistry Departments at Haverford College.  In the Biology Department, the instrument is used in a junior level laboratory course, required of all majors, focusing on the study of secondary structure and stability in fibrinogen.  In addition, plans are being developed to use the instrument both in a sophomore level biochemistry course and a junior level Chemistry laboratory course.  Thus, a major goal for the use of this instrument beyond our research is to train students in interdisciplinary approaches to science.

Technical <br/>    	Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall tumors to form on susceptible plants by stably transforming the host organism with a 20-kb fragment of single-stranded DNA (the T-DNA) encoding plant growth hormone biosynthetic enzymes.  The VirB proteins mediate export of this oncogenic DNA from the bacterium.  The focus of this study is the protein-protein interactions mediating recognition by the transport machinery of the various substrates that utilize the VirB pore.  These substrates include not only the T-DNA, but also a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (VirE2) involved in targeting the T-DNA to the nucleus of the host cell, and a DNA-protein complex derived from the mobilizable plasmid RSF1010, which appears to compete for access to the transport apparatus, inhibiting delivery of the other substrates. A novel chromosomally-encoded, 40 kD membrane protein, which the PI discovered earlier, interacts with VirE2. This protein will be purified, taking advantage of its affinity for VirE2, and its partial amino acid sequence determined. Degenerate primers will be designed accordingly and used to isolate a genomic clone for quantitative production and further characterization of this protein. Generation of alkaline phosphatase fusions and antisera will facilitate studies on the membrane topology and probing potential interactions with other components of the VirB transport machinery.  Gene disruption will be used to assess directly the role of the 40 kD protein in virulence, specifically in the delivery of VirE2 to host plant cells.  Strikingly, this protein appears to be destabilized in cells carrying RSF1010 or by over-production of one component of the VirB pore, VirB10; both of these conditions also result in an inhibition of VirE2 export.  To pursue these observations, turnover of the 40 kD protein in response to production of an RSF1010-derived transfer intermediate will be measured.  In a second set of experiments, a mutant screen will be initiated in the hopes of identifying one or more VirB proteins responsible for activating release of a substrate through the VirB pore in response to host-cell contact. Screening for plant cell-independent secretion of VirE2 will identify such mutants.  Together, these studies should provide some insight into the process by which DNA and/or associated proteins are recognized and transported across the two apolar membranes that enclose the Agrobacterium cell.  Molecular dissection of the mechanism mediating export of these virulence determinants will, in turn, enhance our understanding of pathogenesis in other organisms, including Bordetella pertussis, Helicobacter pylori, and Legionella pneumophila, that utilize homologous transport systems to deliver their pathogenic substrates.<br/><br/>2. Non-technical <br/>	The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes a disease in which tumors form on certain plants.  The symptoms result from the transfer of a piece of DNA from the bacterium to the susceptible plant cell.  Movement of a protein, VirE2, is also required for efficient tumor formation. The goal of this study is to elucidate the mechanism by which the disease-causing DNA and VirE2 are recognized and delivered through the membrane surrounding the bacterium into the host plant cell.  The VirB proteins are known to mediate this transport; we have identified an additional novel, non-VirB, component that appears to interact with VirE2.  The hypothesis to be tested is that this protein may allow the VirB transport apparatus to engage with VirE2, since the protein is no longer detectable under conditions that are known to block VirE2 movement from the bacterium. The gene encoding this protein will be cloned to generate this protein in quantity so that if and how the protein interacts with the VirB proteins can be determined.  A  second line of experimentation will also be initiated to investigate how contact with the plant cell triggers transport of the VirE2 from the bacterium.  This will be done by searching for mutants that release VirE2 even in the absence of a host plant cell.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This phenomenon, known as stress-induced analgesia (SIA) occurs in both humans and other animals and can be studied in the laboratory.

Both males and females exhibit SIA, however, we have shown that males and females use different neurotransmitters to inhibit pain. These studies will focus on sex-specific analgesia pathways in laboratory mice. We will determine how female sex hormones like progesterone influence the neurotransmitters that are used to produce SIA by administering progesterone and its metabolites to male and female mice that have undergone removal of their own hormonal influences via surgical excision of ovaries or testes. We will then assess which neurotransmitters are used to produce pain inhibition in response to stressful situation (a forced swim in cold water). A complete understanding of the hormonal basis for an important sex difference in analgesia pathways is necessary for the possible development of effective treatments of pain in both men and women that may be derived from the research laboratory.<br/>"

The optical light from the stellar component of the stripped matter provides a tracer of this mass and could, depending on the epoch at which it was stripped, provide a map of the dark matter in the cluster.  This project is to observe the diffuse, intergalactic light in several clusters of galaxies.  All of these clusters have mass estimates deduced from galaxy velocity dispersions using the virial theorem, from X-ray profiles using hydrostatic equilibrium, and from observations of gravitational lensing of background galaxies.  The measurement of diffuse light will provide an additional constraint on the distribution of mass in these clusters as well as confirmation of the stripping hypothesis.  In addition, the brightness of intracluster light strongly constrains the dwarf star content of the dark matter.  The question of the low mass star content of dark matter has arisen because of the discovery of microlensing by low mass objects in the halo of the Milky Way.   The previous observations of the core of the rich cluster Abell 2029 have revealed what could be a tidal stripping event near the cluster center.  If this interpretation is correct, there is an excellent opportunity to study one of the most important processes in the evolution of clusters and it will be studied in more detail with high angular resolution observations of the tidal nebula, as well as with spectroscopic observations of the primary embedded galaxy and the nearby galaxies.<br/><br/>The diffuse emission to be detected in the intergalactic regions of superclusters of galaxies is not the optical light from stars but rather the X-ray emission from hot, ionized gas.  It has been clear for some time that the preponderance of baryonic matter in the universe must be in the form of ionized gas.  If this gas in superclusters is at the virial temperature then it should emit bremsstrahlung X-rays.  Diffuse 10 keV energy emission from the plane of the local supercluster has been detected its nature will be investigated.  The interaction of this gas with the CMB is also expected to be the source of a Sunayev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.  The expected signal is just at the sensitivity limit of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite's DMR radiometers, but should be detectable with the new MAP and PLANCK satellite observatories.  The feasibility of such observations will be investigated by modeling both Galactic contamination to the CMB radiation and the random fluctuations in the CMB.   There is also involvement in a project to detect X-ray emission from the nearby Shapley supercluster using the RXTE X-ray satellite and the prospects for detecting the SZ effect in that cluster will be investigated.<br/>"

Early in meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair, synapse, and exchange although the exact order in which these events occur may not be the same in all organisms. These events are highly regulated in a poorly understood process called crossover control. Failure to carry out these early events leads to chromosome non-disjunction and loss. Mutations that cause non-disjunction are known in many organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in C. elegans that result in X chromosome non-disjunction or loss in either meiotic division in either germline in the XX hermaphrodite are evidenced by a high incidence of XO male self-progeny, and such Him mutations are easy to recognize.  Among the genes with a Him mutant phenotype, two autosomal genes, him-5 and him-8, are the focus of this research.  Recessive mutations in either gene change both the number and the distribution of exchanges on the X chromosome, and cause very high rates of X chromosome non-disjunction. Both genes have been cloned. The him-8 gene appears to correspond to one transcript from a locus with a complex transcription pattern, whereas the him-5 locus appears to be much simpler. This will be confirmed in each case further molecular analysis and sequencing known mutant alleles. Significantly, each gene product is predicted to be a small, highly basic protein that would be expected to be involved in some aspect of chromosome structure The expression pattern of each gene will be examined by RT-PCR at different developmental stages, in both sexes, and in various mutant strains affecting meiosis and germ-line development. In addition, by immunofluoresence studies, the location of each protein within the gonad will be determined, which allows strong inferences about the roles of these genes in early meiosis. If possible, the nuclear and chromosomal location of these proteins will also be determined.  One model has postulated that changes in meiotic chromosome structure are integral to crossover control. The effect of these genes on X-chromosome recombination and their predicted protein products fit this model. Further investigation on crossover control will be carried out, both for the X chromosome and for one autosome. One particular autosomal region with an unusual high rate of crossing over will be investigated in more detail. The effect of these him genes on crossover control will be assessed by doing these experiments in both wild-type and him mutant backgrounds.<br/>	<br/>All of these experiments will be carried out by undergraduate students under the direction of the principal investigator. Because meiosis is a fundamental process whose main characteristics have been known for decades, most students are familiar in its basic properties.

There is a strong technological motivation for such progress in that bi-metallic systems encompass surface alloy systems and also have important relevance for surface magnetism and catalysis.  Recently the PI has modeled a prototypical bi-metallic, epitaxial system, the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Rh on the Ag(001) surface.  Extensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results are available for this system and these display several unusual structural features, most notably the occurrence of holes in the silver substrate.  The PI has developed a model for treating the surface kinetics of this and similar systems at the atomic level, a detailed account, in other words, for the atomic scale movements that occur to produce the structures seen.  The model is based on a simple, but physically reasonable approximation for the energy barriers governing local atomic arrangement, which forms the basis of a powerful simulation program which generates and characterizes the evolution of the resulting surface features. This approach has already succeeded in qualitatively accounting for the interesting structures seen for the Rh/Ag(001) system, and a first report has recently been submitted for publication.  The present work will extend this treatment and model other regimes and systems in collaboration with the experimental group of Behm in Ulm, Germany.  Behm's group has extensive experimental capability for study of bi-metallic growth systems an is in fact the source of much of the STM data for the Rh/Ag(001) system.  Further refinement of our model for the Rh/Ag(001) system is needed and it will be extended to the multi-layer case and to other temperature regimes.  The modeling will be applied to other bi-metallic growth systems, including some with catalytic relevance.

This is a central issue of immunology that defines how lymphocytes differentiate and adapt in a way that optimizes their antigen specificity during an immune response. This project focuses on the specific question of whether there is a maturation of the receptor repertoire in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), those cells responsible for cellular immune responses, that is similar to what is observed for the B lymphocytes, those lymphocytes responsible for making secreted antibodies.  The first part of the project will be a comparison of the sequence repertoires of the two polypeptide chains of CTL receptors to a specific antigen to determine if there are differences in the repertoires in primary and secondary (memory) responses.  Differences will be related to the way the genetic elements responsible for the receptors are selected and rearranged during cell differentiation.  The effect of antigen concentration on repertoires and possible differences in receptor density on the surface of cells will also be explored.  The second part of the project is a study of B lymphocytes to determine if subpopulations of this class of cells can be identified that would account for preferential expression of certain receptor structures by these cells.  A third part of the project is to initiate a survey of B lymphocyte genes to identify those genes that are differentially expressed during cell selection and maturation in response to antigen.

Lay Summary    A basic question in immunology is why immature T lymphocytes respond so differently to stimulation compared to their mature descendants.  Mature T lymphocytes are important participants in the immune response because they protect the body from viruses and tumors by (a) recognizing and attacking abnormal or infected cells and (b) alerting other parts of the immune system to their presence.  T cells recognize threatening cells by binding foreign protein (antigen) to receptors, called T cell receptors, on their surfaces.  Every T lymphocyte expresses a different T cell receptor.  Therefore the large population of T cells in the body can collectively defend the body against a large range of threatening cells.  New T cells with new receptors are generated every day as T cells develop from immature precursors in an organ called the thymus.  The receptors expressed by the immature cells (called thymocytes) are randomly generated.  Because each new thymocyte expresses a brand new receptor, the cell must be tested for its suitability before being released into the body.  The screening for suitable cells occurs at a pivotal stage of development, the ""double positive"" (DP) stage, so-called because these cells express two key proteins, CD4 and CD8.  DP thymocytes are the immediate precursors of mature T cells.  However, the vast majority of DP thymocytes are never selected to become mature thymocytes because their receptors are deemed useless or directed against a normal antigen of the body.  The fate of the DP cells during this screening process is governed almost entirely by the signals they receive from their new receptors.  Interestingly, DP thymocytes interpret receptor signals very differently from mature T cells.  When mature T cells receive a strong signal through their receptor, they become activated and start to divide.  When immature DP thymocytes receive the same signal, they also b ecome activated but do not divide.  Nothing, in fact, seems to induce cells at this early stage of development to multiply.  The reason for this is not yet known.  To determine why DP thymocytes fail to divide in response to T cell receptor signals, these studies will compare the molecular machinery responsible for cell division in immature DP and mature T cells.  These studies will also test the possibility that the inability of a DP thymocyte to divide may be critical to the success of this screening process which fundamentally shapes the immune response."

IBN-9724068  The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of pain inhibition in male and female mice.  The experience of pain is dependent not only on peripheral activation of pain receptors but also on influences from higher brain centers that modulate the pain experience. Pain usually serves as a warning signal, preventing further use of the injured area to promote healing; however,  there are situations when pain perception would be counter-adaptive such as during conditions of ""fight-or-flight"" when the brain perceives a threatening situation and temporarily blocks any incoming pain messages to allow the organism to cope with the potentially pain producing event, and live to fight or flee again.  This phenomenon of pain inhibition during threatening events is known as ""stress-induced analgesia"", or SIA.  Many animals, including humans, exhibit SIA responses under a wide variety of ""stressful"" laboratory and real-life situations.  That the brain has the ability to inhibit pain perception implies that there may be ways of artificially activating these systems to treat pain in individuals who are unable to experience pain relief by currently available methods, such as those suffering from chronic pain.   It is believed that non-traditional methods of producing analgesia such as hypnosis, acupuncture, or even placebo analgesia, are due to the activation of endogenous pain inhibitory pathways.  Another minimally invasive way to activate the brain's own mechanisms of pain relief is to use pharmaceuticals which mimic the action of the neurotransmitters which are normally used to communicate between neurons in the pain inhibition pathway.   Morphine works in this way to produce analgesia by binding to receptors in pain inhibitory pathways which normally accept the brain's own opiate peptides (the endorphins, enkephalins and dynorphins).  However, morphine has several liabilities when used in a clinical setting over prolonged periods (such as is necessary for the treat ment of chronic pain), so investigators are currently examining other non-opioid neurotransmitters which play a role in pain inhibition as possible candidate systems for analgesic drug development. One system that has been implicated in non-opioid SIA is the excitatory amino acid class of neurotransmitters (glutamate and aspartate) which bind to the NMDA subtype of receptor.  Recent research has established the existence of NMDA-mediated SIA in mice; however, this appears to be specific to male mice only.  The non-opioid analgesia displayed by female mice following the same stressor (3-min cold water swim), while equivalent in magnitude to that exhibited by males, cannot be characterized as being NMDA-mediated, and therefore must involve other neurotransmitters.  Follow-up research determined that females have a mechanism of non-opioid analgesia that is specific to their gender, and is dependent on the presence of estrogen for it's expression.  The goal of the PI is to determine which neurotransmitters are responsible for non-opioid analgesia in female mice of varying ages, and  how varying hormonal states influence the neurochemical nature of the analgesia exhibited following swim stress.  This should lead to a better understanding of the neurotransmitters that underlie non-opioid SIA in female mice and may contribute to the development of analgesic drugs that will be particularly effective at combating pain in the female."

Refined radio-wavelength searches for various classes of fluctuations in  the cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) will tell us more about the  early phases of structure formation, at the high end of this crucial  redshift interval. Optical, IR and radio observations of galaxies or galaxy  fragments at z = 1-3 are already providing important clues to the final  stages of galaxy formation (e.g., the onset of star formation).    Searches for CBR fluctuations and radio wavelength observations of high  redshift galaxies will be carried out.  The goal of the research is to help  bridge the gap in our understanding of cosmic evolution during the epoch  corresponding to redshifts (z) = 1-1000.    A study of the Hubble Deep Field at radio wavelengths will be carried out.  The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is a small but typical region of the sky  selected by astronomers for intensive study at all wavelengths, beginning  with a very deep Space Telescope exposure late last year. The aim is to use  observations across the electromagnetic spectrum to move our understanding  of galaxy evolution forward. Our radio observations will be carried out at  the Very Large Array at 8.4 and 1.4 GHz and with angular resolution from  10"" down to 0.4"" (close to the Space Telescope resolution).  Among the  scientific goals of our observations are:  --measuring radio spectra and morphologies to determine the nature of the  radio emission (synchrotron from supernova activity? active galactic  nuclei?)    --refining counts of radio source s at low flux densities    --examining the correlation of radio and optical luminosities    --improving limits on fluctuations in the CBR on angular scales 6""-80""    --searching for the microwave signals produced by clusters or protoclusters  of galaxies at z > 1.    Several related projects will parallel these efforts, including further  work on foreground sources of noise which interfere with searches for CBR  fluctuations, planning for a European space mission to map the CBR, and  near infrared observations of both high redshift galaxies already observed  at the VLA and of the 2-4 micron cosmic microwave background.

It has been recognized for a  number of years that the primary structure of rRNA plays a  crucial role in the reactions of protein synthesis.The  discovery of the catalytic capabilities of a number of RNA  molecules including rRNA has refocused attention on the  functional capabilities of RNA. However, even in the most  completely described ribosome, that of the procaryote E.  coli ,the relationship between structure and function is  still incompletely understood. Genetic and biochemical  methods are used here to study the relationship between the  primary structure and function in the 30S subunit of the  ribosomes of E. coli. The focus is on bases which are  involved in a number of reactions which assure the accuracy  of protein synthesis: those in the 530 and 980 loop regions  and positions 1492 and 1493 of 16S rRNA of 30S ribosomes.  The mutated region of rDNA is cloned into plasmids  containing the rRNA operon under the control of constitutive  or inducible promoters to permit the study of any type of  mutation, including those which are lethal to the cell. To  study the effects of these mutations, in vivo studies have  been carried out to determine the effect of mutant 30S  ribosomes on cell viability and the ability of these  ribosomes to synthesize proteins and accurately translate  mRNA coding for b-galactosidase. These studies have  demonstrated, for the first time, that position 981 is  essential for translation.  It is now proposed to try to  define the steps in protein synthesis in which each of the  mutated bases are essential. To determine the accuracy and  extent of translation, a linked transcription-translation  system will be used to study the translation of mRNA  transcribed from a plasmid coding for a small molecular  weight protein of known sequence employing an extract of  cells containing mutant ribosomes. Addition al in vitro  experiments will be carried out to assemble a homogeneous  population of mutant 30S ribosomes to study many of the  partial reactions of protein synthesis. ""Suppressors"" of  lethal mutations will be selected to identify bases, distant  on the primary structure of rRNA, which affect a common  function. Selection of ""suppressor"" mutations which may be  involved in translational initiation can help us to identify  bases in rRNA which are specifically involved in initiation  of protein synthesis. These studies should help ultimately  to genetically identify the components involved at each step  of protein synthesis.  %%%  All cellular proteins are synthesized by complex organelles  called ribosomes. which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)  and protein. However, even in the most completely described  ribosome, that of the procaryote E. coli, the relationship  between structure and function is incompletely understood.  The discovery of the catalytic capabilities of a number of  RNA molecules has refocused attention on the functional  capabilities of rRNA. Our studies use genetic and  biochemical methods to study this relationship. A rRNA gene  can be mutated at a specific, crucial position and  introduced into the cell on a special vector which permits  the study of lethal changes. The focus is on specific  positions which are involved in assuring the accuracy of  protein synthesis. We propose to define the steps in protein  synthesis which are affected by each of the mutated  positions.  It is important to thoroughly study this process  since it is essential for cell growth and development, and  the basis of much production biotechnology. These studies  will involve undergraduate students in every phase and  constitute a major part of their biology training. These  students will thus be learning first hand the importance and  excitement of molecu1ar biology in solving fundamental  biological questions.  ***"

Pasternack of Swarthmore College for the study of   synthetic and biological light-harvesting systems, with emphasis on the   technique of resonance light scattering.  Supported through the Special   Projects Office of the Division of Chemistry, the center is a   collaboration of faculty and students from Swarthmore, Haverford, and   Goucher Colleges.  The interdisciplinary research seeks to determine the   molecular parameters that are necessary for resonance light scattering   from aggregrated chromophores and to formulate a general theoretical   description of the process.  Further, the research will develop   techniques of dynamic resonance light scattering to study the dimensions   of chromophore aggregrates and the mechanisms of aggregation and of   time-resolved resonance light scattering to probe photochemical processes   involving energy and electron transfer.  A central facility, to be   located at Swarthmore, will house a versatile laser light scattering   apparatus capable of both static and dynamic light scattering   experiments, angle-dependent scans, and polarization-dependent   measurements.   Center research into the interactions of light with synthetic and   biological systems contributes to the new NSF initiative in optical   sciences and engineering.  In addition to generating new knowledge on   light-harvesting systems, the center provides undergraduate students from   three colleges with an interdisciplinary, collaborative research   experience.  The center is a premier example of the integration of   research and education."

Long term cultures of B cells derived from primary and memory mice immunized with fluoresceinated macromolecules (as the antigen) will be generated by fusion with myeloma cells.   The density of the fluorescein on the carrier as well as the nature of the carrier used for immunization , will be varied to alter the extent of T cell help in the development of the antibody response.  The DNA sequences of IgM anti-fluorescein antibodies from primary and memory mice will be compared to determine whether there is  evidence for a unique population of secondary B cells expressing an antibody repertoire different from that secreted by animals recognizing the antigen for the first time.  Sequence comparisons will also be made between antibodies derived from animals in which T cell help has been optimized or minimized. Cytotoxic T cells from memory and primary mice  differ in their abilities to recognize and respond to cells with low densities of surface antigens, but the biological mechanisms for these differences are not understood.  This proposal will test whether immunization with fluorescein-coupled cells increases the frequency of fluorescein-response cytotoxic T cell precursors, whether different populations of cytotoxic T cells respond after the animal is antigenically experienced, or whether each type of cytotoxic T cells responds after the animal becomes antigenically experienced, or whether each individual cytotoxic T cell proliferates more efficiently and or binds more effectively to its target cells once it had prior antigenic exposure.   Cytotoxic T cells will be generated from primary and memory mice, fused with long-lived tumor cells and their receptor genes analyzed by DNA sequencing.  Cell surface density of the receptor and its associated molecules will be measured by flow cytometry, and the frequencies of  cytotoxic T cell precursors measured by limiting dilution analyses. %%%  These studies looking at differences in cells of the immune system during primary and secondary immune responses will increase our understanding of the basis of immunological memory.  ***                                              Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\WWUSER\TEMPLATE\NORMAL.DOT                                       Abstract                            Barbara   S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Zain                        Shirley Parker              @     W1 8                          @                                   @      J4E                                                                                                  @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      3                                                                                       ;                                                                         e =       e               4   L                   4                                       l       l   l       l       l       l       l                                                                           1                                                                   3       5       5       5       S               s           T       6                           l                                                                                         l       l                                                                       l               l               3                                       l       l       l       l               3                                                                                                             Abstract 9507010 Owen    This proposal is studying the differences in lymphocytes responding to a foreign body for the first time (primary response) and those lymphocytes responding after having had prior exposure to that antigen (memory response).

The disease results from a complex interaction that is initiated when the bacterium binds to the plant cell surface at a wound site. The bacterium has the unusual ability to transfer a fragment of DNA (the T DNA) into a host plant cell and deliver the DNA to the nucleus, where it becomes part of the host plant's genome. Extensive molecular characterization over the past several years has helped elucidate the process of T DNA production within the bacterium, as well as the mechanism by which a molecule of bacterial origin is directed to a specific compartment in a eukaryotic cell. One of the fun damental aspects of this plant pathogen interaction that remains shrouded in mystery is the actual transport process mediating export of the T DNA from the bacterium and delivery into the plant cell. A multiprotein channel or pore complex has been hypothesized to allow passage of the T DNA (and its associated proteins) through the two membranes that surround the bacterium. Several candidate proteins have been identified that could make up such a transport apparatus; these proteins are encoded by the virB operon on the large tumor inducing (T) plasmid that carries many of the virulence associated genes (as well as the T DNA itself). Recent results from a number of labs including our own have shed some light on the localization and other characteristics of many of the VirB proteins; these observations support a model in which several VirB proteins interact to form a T DNA transport pore, while others many function as chaperones and/or sources of energy for the translocation event. The proposed studies are designed to determine which VirB proteins interact to form oligomeric complexes. Genetic analyses will take advantage of point mutations in the virB10 gene that result in a loss of tumor formation; potentially interacting species will be identified by screening for compensatory changes in a second virB gene that can suppress the avirulent phenotype of the original mutant. A second genetic approach will utilize the ""dihybrid"" strategy, in which proteins or protein fragments are tested for their ability to bring together two domains of a yeast transcriptional activator such as the GAL4 protein. These genetic studies will be complemented by biochemical experiments designed to explore the composition of VirB protein containing aggregates. Together, these studies should provide some insight into the mechanism by which a large polar molecule such as the T DNA and associated proteins is transported across the two apolar membranes that enclose the Agrobacterium cell. Molecular dissection of the structure  and function of the putative transfer apparatus will, in turn, help elucidate the processes and interactions mediating assembly of what is thought to be an elaborate membrane associated complex. %%% The soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects susceptible plants, resulting in unregulated cell division and crown gall tumor formation. This disease can be thought of as ""plant cancer"" in that, as with human tumors, cells are multiplying at an inappropriate time and/or place. Infection by Agrobacterium involves the movement of a piece of DNA (the T DNA) from the bacterium into the host plant cell. This unusual interaction is the only known naturally occurring example of DNA transfer from one kingdom (bacterial) to another (plant). We are especially interested in the mechanism by which a large water loving molecule of DNA is able to cross the oily membrane that surrounds the bacterial cell. T DNA processing and transfer are mediated by a number of bacterial virulence (Vir) proteins. One group of Vir proteins, the VirB proteins, are believed to play a direct role in allowing the T DNA to exit the bacterial cell, most likely by interacting to form an opening in the bacterial membrane through which the T DNA is transferred. We plan to test this hypothesis, using both genetic and biochemical approaches, by studying defective VirB proteins that do not permit T DNA movement, and by isolating complexes of VirB proteins. ***                                      ;                                                                                                                               @                                                                                                                                                       ....()()))()()                                                                          ;"

Heat Shock Protein (HSP70)  family are special proteins that interact with many other types of proteins in cells to assist both their proper folding and assembly. Biological processes known to require HSP70 function include such diverse examples as response to stress, protein targeting and secretion, assembly of steroid hormone receptors, viral replication and the initiation of gene transcription.  Recent evidence implicates members of the HSP70 chaperone family in the construction of larger intracellular structures such as the microtubule cytoskeleton.  During an investigation into the assembly of a microtubule-containing organelle, the eukaryotic flagellum of the green alga Chlamydomonas, an HSP70 family member was identified. Immunofluorescent localization experiments demonstrated that this HSP70 protein was concentrated in the tips of flagella.  This localization is significant, as previous work has shown that the tips are the sites of flagellar assembly.  A combination of molecular, cytological and cell biological techniques will be employed to further characterize the in vivo role of this molecular chaperone.  This investigation offers significant opportunities for novel insight into the processes which govern cytoskeletal assembly in living cells.  Because flagella are present on many different cell types, including cells of the human body, investigations in the green alga Chlamydomonas should reveal details about conserved processes of macromolecular assembly applicable to understanding the formation of other microtubule-containing structures, such as the mitotic spindle or interphase microtubule cytoskeleton.  %%%   Living cells are dynamic systems that contain architectural elements that give them form and shape.  These structures must be assembled and disassembled at appropriate times and places in order for the cells to function properly.  This investigation examines the role a special kind of protein called a ""chape rone"" may play in this process.  This project should further our understanding of normal cellular functions and address a key mechanism in life.  ***"

The interdisciplinary field of medical physics offers  an exciting opportunity to create general audience courses which  teach a great deal of basic physics in the context of learning how  sophisticated medical instrumentation works. Importantly, the  physics is limited in scope to relatively few topics, but these can  be explored in depth. For example, geometrical optics plays a role  in the understanding of fiber optic scopes, laser surgery, and  ultrasound, while the concept of energy occupies a central place in  the discussion of both laser surgery and radiation therapy. The  main outcome of this project would be curricular materials for  dissemination: a complete set of lecture notes, written at the  appropriate level for a general audience course, supporting  materials such as sample problems and demonstrations, and five  original discovery-oriented laboratories which blend the essential  science with medical applications. The latter will be appropriate  for either a general audience course or for introducing topical  applications into standard freshman physics. All three components,  lecture notes, problems, and labs, have been designed to emphasize  conceptual learning in conjunction with core quantitative  techniques, such as estimation, modeling of data, and engineering  design concerns.

Integration of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens               T-DNA into the plant genome results in characteristic pathology.                Bacterial infection involves transfer of T-DNA and some proteins                from the bacterium to the plant.  T-DNA and virE2 protein transfer              is mediated by proteins which are products of the bacterium virB                operon.  Studies planned are aimed at:  (1) characterizing the                  behavior of the virB proteins, particularly the possible formation              of membrane-associated aggregates.  Cross-linking approaches will               be employed.  The expression stoichiometries of the virB proteins               will be examined.  The roles of individual virB proteins in the                 transport process will be evaluated via mutations of individual                 virB genes.  (2) The transport mechanism itself will be examined                through use of chemically modified or mutagenically modified virE2              protein, which may interfere with the transport mechanism.                      %%%                                                                             Plant pathogens play an important role in the dynamics of the                   planetary biomass.  More specifically, these pathogens affect                   ornamental as well as agriculturally important species.  Therefore,             beyond the intrinsic interest in the assembly of a complex system               to transfer genetic information from the bacterium to the plant,                the characterization of the infection process may lead to                       development of selective intervention strategies with economic and              environmentally positive consequences.  The studies planned utilize             biochemical and genetic approaches to characterize the mechanisms               by which bacteria infect susceptible plants."

One of the consequences of this              difference in energetics is that the surface atoms can arrange                  themselves differently than the bulk.  These rearranged atoms can               result in the surface layer having different physical properties                than the bulk solid.  For instance, certain surface structures are              better than others for catalysis.  The proposed research will study             two classes of surface reconstruction in two model systems.  The                results will help to understand why specific surface structures are             formed in these materials."

Most of the experimental effort in                   the last twenty years has been directed at developing detectors                 which are sensitive to the millisecond bursts of radiation                      expected to accompany the gravitational collapse of stellar                     objects.                                                                             A useful benchmark with which to compare limits on a                       stochastic background is the closure density of the universe.                   The existence of a background with an energy density much                       larger than this would conflict with current limits on the                      deceleration parameter.  The limits implied by pulsar timing                    and microwave background isotropy are both several orders of                    magnitude below closure density per octave.  Limits on a                        millihertz stochastic background derived from terrestrial                       seismic observations are much higher, several times closure                     density per octave; however, using the earth as a GW detector                   has the advantage of providing discrimination against intrinsic                 fluctuations in the detector.  This is virtually impossible for                 the above two methods.

The                     absence of an average excitation of the oS2 and 4S2 modes                       allowed him to set upper limits on a background of                              gravitational waves at 0.31 mHz and 1.72 mHz of a few times the                 critical density of the universe per octave which is several                    orders of magnitude lower than previous limits.  Under this                     award, he would search for pulse excitation of the oS2 modes by                 analyzing the data of the quietest IDA stations during periods                  of low seismic background noise.  The sensitivity limit which                   is imposed by background seismic noise corresponds to a                         dimensionless strain amplitude of h < 10-13.

The CTL                     response to fluorescein-coupled cells will be used as a model                   system.  A variety of structural homologues of fluorescein can be               coupled to the surfaces of stimulator and target cells and used                 to define the fine specificity of the responding CTLs.  An                      extensive number of short term monoclonal fluorescein-specific                  CTL populations will then be determined by analysis of the                      reactivity patterns of each of the clones on the panel of                       fluorescein homologues as well as variants of the stimulating                   major histocompatibility molecule.  Simultaneously, methodologies               for the derivation of long term clones of primary and secondary                 CTLs will be refined in order to ascertain the use of particular                receptor gene combinations in early and late CTL populations.                   One of the proposed techniques for the generation of long term                  CTL clones which will be tested involves a novel, and potentially               extremely useful application of hybridoma technology, in which                  DNA derived from a tumor cell is transfected directly into an                   activated CTL.                                                                       The overall goal of this research is to further                            understanding of the nature of immunological memory.  In                        particular, it asks the question:  ""How does the population of                  antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes derived from a                         previously immunized animal differ from that recognizing the same               antigen but obtained from an immunologically naive animal?""                     Previous results from this laboratory have shown that cytotoxic                 lymphocytes from previously immunized animals are capable of                    recognizing cell surface attached antigen at a lower density than               are lymphocytes from non-immune animals.  The current research is               directed toward determining the factor(s) controlling this                      difference. The results of this research should increase our                    fundamental understanding of the mechanism of immunological                     memory."

The ribosome is a large complex ribonucleoprotein particle.                     The rRNA plays an important role in its function.  This                         includes base-pairing with mRNAs during translational                           initiation in prokaryotic systems, and possibly, other                          'catalytic' roles in the reactions of protein synthesis.                        These proposed interactions may involve a small region of                       primary structure or regions of RNA far apart on the primary                    structure, brought physically close by the higher order                         structure of the ribosome.  To investigate the relationship                     between the primary structure of rRNA and various functional                    roles, binding or catalytic, we are utilizing the procedures                    of site-specific mutagenesis.  Base changes are made to test                    if (a) the mutant rRNA will be incorporated into ribosomes                      and, if incorporated, (b) will they affect a specific                           reaction of protein synthesis.  Ideally a single base change                    in an important functional region will interfere with a                         unique stage of protein synthesis.  Ultimately, the                             identification of all bases involved in a unique function                       will establish the ""active"" site for that reaction.  Specific                   aims:  1. Production of site-specific mutations in 16S and                      23S rRNA at putative functional sites using a plasmid coded                     rrnB operron.  2. Synthesis of mutant ribosomes.  Mutant rDNA                   molecules in different plasmids will be transformed into E.                     coli, where specific in vivo functional tests will be carried                   out.  Mutant rRNA molecules will also be studied when under                     control of a number of non-rRNA promoters which allows the                      controlled expression of mutant rRNA molecules and allows for                   the study of mutations which when uncontrolled, are lethal to                   the cell.  3. Structural and functional assay of mutant                         ribosomes.  A. In vivo tests will include: (i) Tests for the                    effects on translation.  For example the mutant rRNA is                         introducted into an E. coli strain carrying a nonsense                          mutation in the Lac Z gene and a suppressor t-RNA.                              Alteration in the level of enzyme will be a measure of the                      effect of the mutant rRNA on translation.  (ii)  Association-                   Dissociation reaction: using the ""maxicell"" system we will                      determine if mutant 30S ribosomes will form 70S ribosomes,                      form polysomes, and recycle as cell-free extracts of E. coli                    and testing for their ability to carry out defined reactions                    of parotein synthesis."

How and                 when galaxies and other large bound systems in the Universe form                is not well understood.  The detection of primeval galaxies,                    galaxies forming their first generation of stars early in the                   history of the Universe and hence at high redshift, would be a                  major step forward.  No such objects have yet been found despite                more than a decade of effort.

The Principal                     Investigators (PIs) will do so by measuring the brightness of the               night sky at near infrared wavelengths using a balloon-borne,                   cooled telescope.  The second is to make careful studies of                     possible local analogs of primeval galaxies, nearby systems which               are currently undergoing massive bursts of star formation.  The                 PIs will look for a characteristic feature or ""tag"" of star                     formation which could then be used to identify primeval galaxies                at much greater distances.  Radio frequency observations will be                made of a range of star-forming systems at low redshifts, and                   also of the ""blue galaxies"" at redshifts 0.1-1.0, which may be at               an intermediate stage of evolution between local starburst                      galaxies and true primeval galaxies.
