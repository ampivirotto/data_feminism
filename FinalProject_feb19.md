# Final Project 

This will be a semester-long project where you identify a real-world
problem and analyze a corresponding data initiative. Your analysis will
critically examine the effort through either the data feminist framework
or other ethical lens, evaluating how data is collected, analyzed, and
used to address the problem.

## General Guidelines

1.  Please cite your sources! You are free to use any style guide you'd
    prefer (MLA, APA, Chicago, IEEE). I won't be checking for total
    accuracy in the rules of your chosen guide.

2.  Double-spaced, 11- or 12-point size, any clear to read font

3.  Honor Code: Please do not copy directly from your group mates. You
    are encouraged to collaborate on researching, discussing, examining,
    coding, analyzing the sources -- but please write up your written
    analysis yourself.

## 

## Part 1: Project Proposal (Due Sunday March 2^nd^ at 11:59 PM)

Objective: Identify a real-world problem and a corresponding data
initiative that aims to address it. Provide an initial critical analysis
of how power structures influence both the problem and the data
initiative itself.

Requirements:

-   Problem Overview: Define the problem, its significance, and who it
    affects.

-   Data Initiative Overview: Describe an existing data initiative
    related to the problem defined. Briefly describe the type of data it
    collects and how the data is used (these points will be further
    investigated in part 2).

-   Matrix of Domination Analysis: Like the previous in-class activity
    we completed, please examine the different domains of power
    (structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal)

-   Provide at least two sources that describe your problem and data
    initiative.

Length: \~2-page written proposal

## Part 2: Data Description & Exploration (Due Sun March 23^rd^ 11:59 PM)

Objective: Critically analyze the data used in the data initiative and
the methodologies utilized in the collection and analysis of the data.

Requirements:

-   Data Availability and Methodology: How do is the data collected?
    What data is collected? How do is the data analyzed? How is the data
    used?

-   Ethical Framework: Does the data collection and analysis align with
    the ethical considerations presented in the Data Feminism framework
    -- or another ethical framework? Who benefits from the data, and who
    might be harmed? Are there data points missing? Who is counted?

-   Optionally, you may present this analysis as a combination of
    written analysis along with coding-based exploration via
    visualizations, exploratory data analysis, etc.

Length: 3- to 5-page written analysis, text optionally supplemented with
code/notebooks

## Part 3: Comparative Methods Analysis (Due: [Friday]{.mark} April 18^th^ 11:59 PM)

Objective: Compare different ways this problem might be addressed by
other data efforts assessing their alignment with your ethical framework
of choice (Data Feminism, Design Justice Network, etc.).

Requirements:

-   Comparative Review: Select at least two additional data initiatives
    that are related to your problem of interest. Examine how these data
    efforts may differ in the methodology, available data, or usage of
    the data.

-   Ethical Analysis: Using your chosen ethical framework, examine
    whether these additional data efforts align with the proposed
    principles. Do the data initiatives prioritize transparency,
    inclusion, equity, pluralism, etc.?

-   Critique: Based on your analysis, which initiative is most
    effective? Can your initial chosen data initiative learn anything
    from these other data efforts?

Length: 3- to 5-page written analysis

## Part 4.1: Final Presentation (Due: Mon April 28 & Wed April 30) 

Objective: Summarize your findings in a final presentation that
critically evaluates the data initiative and its ability to address the
original problem of interest.

Requirements:

-   Examine Problem: Summarize your problem and who it impacts.

-   Examine Data Initiative: Examine the data effort, its methodology,
    type of data collected, and usage of data specifically how it aligns
    with a chosen ethical framework.

-   Compare to other Data Initiatives: Briefly discuss how other efforts
    might attempt to answer the same or similar problem. How do these
    other efforts work similarly or differently?

-   Summarize: Suggest ways the original chosen initiative might be
    improved or lessons it could learn from other data efforts. These
    could include your own suggestions or analysis as well.

Length: 15 minutes total: 10-12 minutes plus questions

## Part 4.2: Final Paper (Due: May 10^th^ 5PM (Seniors) and May 16^th^ 12:30PM (all other students)) 

Objective: Incorporating feedback from previous assignments and the
presentation, summarize your findings about your data initiative of
interest, examine its alignment with a chosen ethical framework, and
assess its effectiveness to address the problem. NOTE: This will likely
include pieces of your previous writings throughout the semester.

Requirements:

-   Introduction: Summary of problem and data initiative (Proposal)

-   Data and Methods: Examination of data methodology of data initiative
    and analysis of the type of data collected and how it's used.
    Optionally can include figures generated from coding-based analysis.
    (Data Exploration)

-   Comparative Analysis: Comparison of two or more data efforts that
    are related to your problem. Examination of the ecosystem of data
    efforts. (Comparative Methods)

-   Discussion: Summarize your analysis of your chosen data effort and
    its ability to address the problem of interest. Are there lessons
    this data effort could learn from other initiatives? Are there other
    ways this data initiative could be improved to effectively address
    the problem?

Length: 7-to-10-page final write-up

Collaboration Policy:\
Students are encouraged to collaborate on research, data analysis, and
coding. You may work in a group to gather sources, explore datasets,
develop visualizations, and critically discuss the data effort from the
desired framework. Additionally, you may work together to prepare and
deliver the final presentation. However, the written components of the
project (proposal, data exploration, comparative analysis, and final
paper) must be completed individually. Each student is responsible for
producing their own written analysis and ensuring their work reflects
their own critical engagement with the topic.
